    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>What is &lt;span&gt;Key Sharing?&lt;/span&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="AxCKSGDBlock1Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Typically, employees share relevant and work-related information with each other. However, worrying about the data’s security during the sharing process is inevitable. Since this raises concern about sharing secured files, it is incredibly vital for encryption software to have a feature that lets you share and receive files more securely.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="AxCKSGDBlock1Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>With the key sharing feature, you can share files &lt;b&gt;without the need to share passwords&lt;/b&gt;. Instead, you can share file keys to specific colleagues to give them access to particular files. Then, they can easily browse or edit the shared file. Even more so, it should allow you to unshare the file to remove the person’s access quickly.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="AxCKSGDBlock1Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Key Sharing is an AxCrypt’s Award-Winning file access sharing feature which is super easy to use, and is designed to maximize file security and privacy.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="AxCKSGDBlock2Heading" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Why AxCrypt &lt;span&gt;Key Sharing &lt;/span&gt;?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="AxCKSGDBlock2Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>AxCrypt's key sharing allows you to keep your files secured while also sharing it with your colleagues. It enables you to collaborate and connect with other members without jeopardising the &lt;b&gt;confidentiality&lt;/b&gt; of your data.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="AxCKSGDBlock2Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Using the key sharing feature, you can give file access to anyone and withdraw it whenever you want; you don't even have to disclose your own password. With their own password, the other user can access the shared files.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="AxCKSGDBlock2Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Key Sharing is built on Zero-Knowledge Encryption, which means that the process of file encryption and decryption occurs on your computer or smartphone. AxCrypt doesn’t know your account password or your files, making AxCrypt have &lt;b&gt;'Zero-Knowledge'&lt;/b&gt; of your data.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="AxCKSGDBlock2Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The Key Sharing feature is designed to prioritize security and privacy of your files. The files are still encrypted with the strong &lt;b&gt;AES-256&lt;/b&gt; bit algorithm when you share it, and the recipients can easily access them at their convenience.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="AxCKSGDBlock2Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Imagine sharing a highly sensitive business document such as a revenue report with your boss or colleague – while ensuring that file is encrypted, even after the recipient opens it, that’s the Key Sharing feature for you.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="AxCKSGDBlock3Heading" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>How Does &lt;span&gt; Key Sharing Work?&lt;/span&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="AxCKSGDBlock3Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>AxCrypt uses &lt;b&gt;Asymmetrical&lt;/b&gt; encryption to securely share the encrypted files. That means public key is used for encryption and private key is used for decryption. AxCrypt generates an &lt;b&gt;RSA-4096&lt;/b&gt; public and private key pair when an account is created. The private key is encrypted with your password.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="AxCKSGDBlock3Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The unique thing about public sharing and private secret key pairs is that while anyone can *encrypt* data with the public sharing key, only the person knowing the private secret key can *decrypt*, and even knowing the public sharing key it’s not possible to figure out the private secret key.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="AxCKSGDBlock3Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>When we encrypt a file, we don’t &lt;b&gt;encrypt&lt;/b&gt; it with your password as the encryption key. We encrypt your file with a random and &lt;b&gt;unique key&lt;/b&gt; every time a file is encrypted. We call this the master file key or session key. It’s this master file key that we encrypt with your password and add to the encrypted file.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="AxCKSGDBlock3Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>We also encrypt this same master file key with your public sharing key from your AxCrypt ID, as well as the public sharing keys of any additional recipients you may have added with the key sharing feature.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="AxCKSGDBlock3Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Once recipients receive a key shared encrypted file, the following operations are performed to decrypt the data,</value>
  </data>
  <data name="AxCKSGDBlock3Text5P1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>AxCrypt uses the recipient’s private key to decrypt the &lt;b&gt;session key&lt;/b&gt; which was encrypted with recipient’s public key. </value>
  </data>
  <data name="AxCKSGDBlock3Text5P2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Upon successful decryption, the session key is used to decrypt the shared file.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="AxCKSGDBlock3Text6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;Note&lt;/b&gt;: The private keys of all users are encrypted with the user’s account password, which are never stored on our servers or even on your computer.</value>

  <data name="AxCPMGDBlock1Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>AxCrypt’s &lt;span&gt;Password Manager&lt;/span&gt; is a powerful and easy-to-use tool for securely managing and sharing your passwords, card details, and notes wherever you are.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="AxCPMGDBlock1Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>AxCrypt secures your data using the strongest encryption algorithm, &lt;span&gt;AES-256&lt;/span&gt;, with &lt;span&gt;Zero-Knowledge Encryption.&lt;/span&gt; This means that access to your data solely resides with you and no one else, not even AxCrypt.</value>
  </data>

    <value>The Password Manager can be accessed from any web browser or using AxCrypt’s mobile apps on &lt;span&gt;Android &amp; iOS&lt;/span&gt;. When data is synchronized to your devices, the data remains encrypted using &lt;span&gt;256-bit symmetric&lt;/span&gt; encryption. Data in-transit is also encrypted with &lt;span&gt;Transport Layer Security (TLS)&lt;/span&gt;.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="AxCPMGDBlock1Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Also, AxCrypt's Password Manager comes equipped with a free &lt;a href='/information/password-generator/'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Password Generator&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tool which can generate 'n' number of strong passwords that are not nonsensical and are possible to remember and type. </value>

  </data>
  <data name="AxCPMGDBlock3Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;Key wrapping&lt;/b&gt; of the password is done using the &lt;b&gt;NIST&lt;/b&gt; specification for AES Key Wrap. The key derived from the password with &lt;b&gt;PBKDF2-SHA512&lt;/b&gt; is only used as a key encrypting key. </value>
  </data>
  <data name="AxCPMGDBlock3Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>When you encrypt your data, AxCrypt uses &lt;b&gt;AES-256 symmetrical&lt;/b&gt; strong encrypting algorithm, with a single key used for both encryption and decryption.</value>

  <data name="AxcryptBusinessBlock2Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Creating a subscription requires an initial purchase of at least one member license, yourself.

  <data name="AxcryptBusinessBlock2Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Start by deciding the number of initial member licenses you need, in addition to yourself. You can always add more later.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="AxcryptBusinessBlock2Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Once you have decided the member licenses, have a valid credit card ready, select a currency and enter the name, address and EU VAT number if applicable.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="AxcryptBusinessBlock2Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>When all is entered you will be presented with a total amount, and a calculation showing your discount (if provided) and VAT being applied.</value>
  </data>

  <data name="AxcryptBusinessBlock3Text3" xml:space="preserve">

    <value>Should you wish to add more members to a subscription, you can do so at any time.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="AxcryptBusinessBlock5Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>When you purchase additional member licenses, it is always for your current subscription period. So, if you have 5 months left until the whole subscription is up for renewal, additional member licenses will only require payment for the remaining 5 months.

    <value>When selecting an encryption software, you must look into its algorithms to determine how your data will be secured or protected. For starters, an encryption algorithm transforms plain text into the encrypted text to prevent hackers from quickly accessing them.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_5KFESSAO_H1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>However, since not all codes or algorithms are equal, some perform faster than the others. To help you better, here are 5 common encryption algorithms that are most undoubtedly unbreakable:</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_5KFESSAO_H1_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;Triple DES – it is a symmetric key method for data encryption. It uses the same key to encipher and decipher messages.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_5KFESSAO_H1_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;RSA – it uses an asymmetric method of encrypting data. In other words, it uses multiple keys for encrypting and decrypting data. These keys are commonly known as “public key” and “private key”.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_5KFESSAO_H1_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;Blowfish – it is a symmetric but general-purpose algorithm. It is highly prevalent in cryptographic software because of its speed, flexibility, and competitiveness, among other encryption algorithms.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_5KFESSAO_H1_Text6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;Twofish – it is a brainchild of Blowfish. It is also flexible and uses a symmetric encryption method. However, Twofish encrypts data of up to 256-bit, while its predecessor only encrypts data of up to 64-bit.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_5KFESSAO_H1_Text7" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;AES – also a symmetric encryption algorithm, it became popular because of its easy implementation. Compared to other competitors, it has a more complex algorithm and is considered to be more effective.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_5KFESSAO_H2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>For some, encrypting data, such as their files’ content, is already enough to ensure its security. However, if you only encrypt the actual data stored, unauthorized users may still have access to view file names, archives, and the like.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_5KFESSAO_H2_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Besides, other people may derive information from having access to your file names. And for someone who wants to protect sensitive company files and other personal data, this can be quite worrisome.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_5KFESSAO_H2_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>For this reason, it is crucial that your encryption software has a feature that lets you encrypt file names. This feature should prevent other people from seeing your file name and require them with a key or password before accessing it. If you want an extra layer of protection to your files, the file name encryption feature can undoubtedly come in handy.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_5KFESSAO_H2_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>On a different note, you might want to check out this article about the various human errors that impact data security.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_5KFESSAO_H3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>As much as you want to protect all the information from your current files, you might also want to protect the data from the files that you want to discard. Since this information may contain sensitive or relevant content to your other files, it is vital to ensure their protection up to the deletion process.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_5KFESSAO_H3_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Hence, when selecting an encryption software, consider looking for a secure deletion feature that lets you securely delete files and wipe free space. Remember that with secure deletion, you can ensure that your files can no longer be restored or retrieved. This way, sensitive data is highly protected and prevents outsiders from accessing these discarded files. Hence, your &lt;a href='https://comparecamp.com/file-management-software/'&gt;file management software should have tight security features&lt;/a&gt;.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_5KFESSAO_H4_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Passwords are extremely valuable, most especially when you are protecting confidential information or projects. These days, however, hackers are more persistent and can obtain passwords quickly. But, what a better way to protect data more effectively than the implementation of a two-factor authentication functionality?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_5KFESSAO_H4_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>As of June 2019, a study from &lt;a href='https://www.statista.com/statistics/1031900/identity-management-tools-used-in-us-organizations/'&gt;Statista&lt;/a&gt; shows that 62% of security-aware IT professionals in</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_5KFESSAO_H4_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>North America stated that their company uses two-factor authentication to verify their identity. On the other hand, 52% use a single-on.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_5KFESSAO_H4_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>This feature should be one of the top things you should consider before committing to a specific encryption software. Adding an extra layer of security not only strengthens security, but it also reduces the risk of cyber breaches to help you build secure online relationships. This can help your company become more credible; hence, it allows you to create a trustworthy reputation among your customers.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_5KFESSAO_H5_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Typically, employees share relevant and work-related information with each other. However, worrying about the data’s security during the sharing process is inevitable. Since this raises concern about sharing secured files, it is incredibly vital for an encryption software to have a feature that lets you share and receive files more securely.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_5KFESSAO_H5_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>With the key sharing feature, you can share files without the need to share passwords. Instead, you can share file keys to specific colleagues to give them access to particular files. Then, they can easily browse or edit the shared file. Even more so, it should allow you to unshare the file to remove the person’s access quickly.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_5KFESSAO_H5_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In addition, one thing that you must bear in mind when it comes to file sharing is to avoid self-decrypting files. Often, these are self-contained executable files. However, since these contain strongly encrypted information, screening for anti-virus is almost impossible. To learn more, you can read this article about why you should avoid self-decrypting files.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_5KFESSAO_H6_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The purpose of encryption software does not only focus on ensuring highly secured data. It also allows you to determine the threats that you might encounter beforehand and help you avoid them in the long run. The best file encryption software should have the ability to meet all of your requirements and provide additional functionalities that can come in handy.</value>

  </data>
  <data name="Blog_5RWEISB_H1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Cyberattacks are increasing in frequency and sophistication, with SMBs being particularly vulnerable. In 2020, over 700,000 attacks against small businesses caused $2.8 billion in damages. Hackers often see SMBs as easy targets due to their limited security infrastructure. Malware is the most common type of cyberattack aimed at small businesses, accounting for 18% of attacks. SMB cybersecurity is more critical than ever, making small business encryption a necessary defense. Implementing strong file security for SMBs can prevent unauthorized access, ensuring SMB data protection even if a breach occurs.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_5RWEISB_H2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Governments worldwide are enforcing stricter data protection laws, requiring businesses to secure customer and employee data. Regulations such as the &lt;a href='https://axcrypt.net/information/regulatory-compliance/gdpr/'&gt;General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href='https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa'&gt;California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)&lt;/a&gt; mandate robust security measures, including encryption. Failing to comply can lead to hefty fines and legal trouble. By encrypting sensitive files, SMBs can meet regulatory requirements and avoid financial and reputational damage. However, only 14% of SMBs currently have a cybersecurity plan in place, highlighting the urgent need for stronger SMB data protection measures.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_5RWEISB_H3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Not all data breaches occur due to external attacks; insider threats, whether intentional or accidental, can be just as damaging. Employees may mishandle data, fall victim to phishing scams, or misuse access privileges. Alarmingly, 95% of cybersecurity breaches are attributed to human error. Approximately 1 in 323 emails sent to small businesses are malicious, further increasing the risk. Encryption helps mitigate the impact of such threats by restricting access to only authorized individuals and ensuring that data remains secure even if leaked.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_5RWEISB_H4_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The shift toward remote work and cloud-based operations has increased the need for strong security measures. Employees frequently access company data from various locations and devices, making it important to protect information at rest and in transit. Small Business encryption ensures that sensitive files stored in the cloud or shared online remain protected from unauthorized access. With 51% of small businesses lacking any IT security measures and 43% lacking a recovery plan, encryption becomes even more critical in safeguarding operations.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_5RWEISB_H5_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>A data breach can severely damage an SMB’s reputation, leading to loss of customer trust and financial setbacks. Studies show that on average, SMBs lose $25,000 due to cyberattacks, and 78% of SMBs worry that a serious cyberattack could put them out of business.

    <value>&lt;strong&gt;Get started with AxCrypt...&lt;/strong&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ADGE_Conclusion_TExt1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Consider encryption as a kind of insurance against potential data breaches. Security may become an asset with a boulder, enterprise-grade encryption and key management tool. You get the option of moving to the public cloud. If you're interested in learning more about encryption, &lt;a href='https://www.axcrypt.net/information/features'&gt;start here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ADGE_H1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>When you discuss encryption with someone who isn't a security expert, you'll typically get a number of responses. Encryption is frequently misunderstood as some kind of sinister technology. Instead, encryption can help in achieving flexibility, compliance, and data privacy that today's virtual age requires.  </value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ADGE_H1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Encryption is the process of transforming plain text into ciphertext, or changing readable text into unreadable text, in order to protect data so that only certain people can access it. Encryption scrambles, or encrypts data and then utilises a key to unscramble or decrypt the information for the receiving party. It proves to be a successful method of safeguarding sensitive data. Data on computers and storage devices, as well as data in transit through networks, are all protected with encryption.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ADGE_H2_SH2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Intercepting emails and other content is just one example of a number of incidents that have occurred in less formal methods. While most emails do not pique the curiosity of other parties enough for them to try to intercept it, there have been instances where this has happened. Emails are not encrypted by default as they travel from your servers to the recipient. This implies that if hackers gain access to this information, they will be able to view your emails and confidential information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ADGE_H2_SH3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>According to a data breach report, employees are directly or indirectly responsible for 34 percent of total attacks. Content can be misappropriated by disgruntled employees or contractors for their own or others' benefit. Any intentional loophole can bring down a whole organization with millions of stolen data. This danger can be mitigated by imposing the appropriate set of access rules to keep privileged users in their “swim lanes”. For instance, the Master Key feature eliminates the risk of losing access to critical files. Check out AxCrypt´s &lt;a href='https://www.axcrypt.net/information/master-key'&gt;Master Key feature here&lt;/a&gt;.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ADGE_H2_SH4_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If the data is not encrypted, the most significant consequence will be the compromise of critical or confidential information by a cyber attack or interference of a third party. If protocols aren't in place to identify any kind of behaviour, organisations can lose large amounts of data before realising it.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ADGE_H2_SH5_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>With more businesses moving to the cloud, security measures must be constantly checked and updated to protect data from leaks. Despite the fact that cloud programmes like Google or Microsoft are well-equipped with security on their end, the user end is still a major source of erroneous mistakes, malicious software, and fraudulent assaults.</value>

    <value>To begin the process of encryption, you need to collect the data you intend to encrypt. The algorithm will then use the encryption key to modify the data in the input and send the result. The output would be a scrambled text that could only be read by the person with the key; you could then transfer the output to the second party via any medium, or preserve the encrypted data for future use. Keys are usually generated with random number generators, or computer algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;</value>

    <value>As a result, while both AES and DES are symmetric key block ciphers, AES is the de facto industry standard and is hence more secure. When it comes to encryption, security is crucial, and the only alternative is AxCrypt, which offers 256-bit encryption in addition to security. All concerns with encryption are resolved by AxCrypt.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_AESDES_H1_SH1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Data Encryption Standard is what it stands for. The DES algorithm can be cracked using specific devices. A key with a 56-bit size is used by the DES algorithm. The DES creates a block of 64-bit cipher text using the 56-bit key after receiving a block of 64-bit plain text as an input.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_AESDES_H1_SH1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Although both AES and DES being the encryption algorithm to encrypt data, there are significant differences between the both, in terms of their working principles, their core functions, their key sizes and their speed and security performances.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_AESDES_H1_SubHeading1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;strong&gt;What is DES encryption?&lt;/strong&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_AESDES_H1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>AES or the &lt;a href='https://axcrypt.net/blog/get-AES-256-bit-encryption-with-axCrypt/'&gt;Advanced Encryption Standard&lt;/a&gt; is a cipher, which is a way to both encrypt and decrypt data. There's a significant probability that your data will be encrypted by some type of AES cipher, such as the AES 256, 192, or 128 -- whenever you transmit files through secure file transfer protocols like HTTPS, FTPS, SFTP, WebDAV, OFTP, or AS2.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_AESDES_H2_SH1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>For any cipher, the most basic technique of attack is brute force, which includes attempting each key until you locate the appropriate one. Finding the right key would take a maximum of 256, or around 72 quadrillion, attempts due to the effective DES key length of 56 bits. This is insufficient for the DES data protection against computerized brute-force attacks. Before AES was used to replace DES, there were probably not many messages that were susceptible to this kind of code-breaking attempt. However, even before DES became a standard, many security experts believed the 56-bit key length was insufficient. So, it’s no longer effective.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_AESDES_H2_SH2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Although the AES data encryption technique is more theoretically sophisticated and attractive, its main advantage is the availability of different key lengths. AES is exponentially more secure than DES's 56-bit key since it lets you select a 128-bit, 192-bit, or 256-bit key. Because key size affects encryption strength, DES became obsolete due to continual advancements in computing technology.</value>

  <data name="Blog_AMEFH_H1_SH1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Phishing assaults have surged sixfold during the pandemic, and mobile devices are now the primary target. Scammers are aware that people who work from home spend more time on their mobile and do not take the same safety measures as they would on a traditional PC. Anyone who stumbles across your phone or laptop can easily access the files contained within; however, with encryption, accessing that data is extremely tough.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</value>

  <data name="Blog_AMEFH_H1_SH2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">

    <value>Mobile Encryption with AxCrypt</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_AMEFH_SH1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Mobile encryption goes above and beyond a regular lock screen password. It is a one-stop for safeguarding all of your personal information and data on your mobile phones from prying eyes or if your mobile gets lost or stolen. Encryption stores your phone's information in an unreadable, jumbled format that can only be read with the correct credentials. This means that if your phone falls into the wrong hands, no one will be able to decipher any of the data unless they know your password.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_AMEFH_SH1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>From saving your data from getting compromised to making your personal details super-secret, mobile encryption can do it all for you. A misplaced or abandoned device poses a significant security risk; particularly if it lacks a strong PIN or password, as well as full data encryption. Sensitive documents and files in the device will be vulnerable to theft. If an encrypted device, on the other hand, falls into the wrong hands or is lost, the owner may rest assured that his or her data is secure and will not be viewed by outsiders without the key.</value>

    <value>&lt;b&gt;Welcome to 2025&lt;/b&gt;. This year marks a critical turning point in the world of cybersecurity as we prepare for emerging threats and groundbreaking trends.

  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ANYANEFSWA_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>However, every problem has a solution. &lt;b&gt;AxCrypt&lt;/b&gt; stands as your best defense against these evolving threats. If you believe you're safe because you're not running a large business or have minimal online connections, think again. Cyberattacks can target anyone, anywhere, at any time.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ANYANEFSWA_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Encryption scrambles your data into unreadable codes, making it nearly impossible for unauthorized entities to access your information. AxCrypt has been at the forefront of promoting encryption and raising awareness because your privacy matters.</value>

    <value>A New Year, a New Era of File Security with AxCrypt</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_AOVO_H2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>We store what we call an AxCrypt ID which is associated with your account on our servers. (Technically this is an RSA-4096 encryption key pair.) This key pair consists of a public sharing and private secret part. When we encrypt a file we don’t really encrypt it with your password as the encryption key. We encrypt your file with a random and unique key every time a file is encrypted. We call this the master file key. It’s this master file key that we actually encrypt with your password and add to the encrypted file. We also encrypt this same master file key with your public sharing key from your AxCrypt ID, as well as the public sharing keys of any additional recipients you may have added with the key sharing feature.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_AOVO_H2_Text10" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;Any private secret key corresponding to a public sharing key used to encrypt the master file key as described above.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_AOVO_H2_Text11" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;em&gt;On the AxCrypt server, we store yours and everyone else’s AxCrypt IDs which consists of the public sharing key, and your private secret key – encrypted as an AxCrypt file using only your password to encrypt the master file key for that file.&lt;/em&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_AOVO_H2_Text12" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Finally, we can tell you what the server is used for!</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_AOVO_H2_Text13" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;ol style='list-style-position: inside;display: grid;gap: 20%;'&gt;&lt;li&gt;To make public sharing keys available to anyone who would potentially want to make encrypted data available to someone else.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To keep a backup of your encrypted private secret key, so if you buy a new device or need to reinstall AxCrypt you can get it back to your device.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To enable global password change for you. If you change your password on our server, we’ll re-encrypt your private key there with the new password and this means that all your already encrypted files will now be decryptable with the new password! Very convenient. You can still also decrypt them with the original password used when the file was encrypted of course.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_AOVO_H2_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>An AxCrypt-encrypted file consists of the following:</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_AOVO_H2_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;The original file encrypted with  AES-128/256 using a random unique master file key.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_AOVO_H2_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;The master file key, encrypted with your password.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_AOVO_H2_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;The master file key, encrypted with your public sharing key.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_AOVO_H2_Text6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;The master file key, optionally encrypted with other recipients public sharing keys.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_AOVO_H2_Text7" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The unique thing about public sharing and private secret key pairs is that while anyone can *encrypt* data with the public sharing key, only the person knowing the private secret part can *decrypt*, and even knowing the public sharing key it’s not possible to figure out the private secret key.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_AOVO_H2_Text8" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>To decrypt an AxCrypt-encrypted file, you need to have either of:</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_AOVO_H2_Text9" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;The original password, to decrypt the master file key.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_AOVO_H3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>There’s also an online password manager, where we can keep track of all of your passwords encrypted with your AxCrypt password. One password to rule them all ;-) This is such a common use of AxCrypt, to encrypt a file with a list of passwords, we thought we could make this even easier.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_AOVO_H4_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Since some of the features of AxCrypt are reserved for paying Premium users, we need to know if you have a valid Premium subscription. To avoid various hacks used by offline software licensing technologies, we keep it simple and secure and keep track of payment status on our server. This is fairly standard procedure.</value>

    <value>Choosing &lt;a href='https://axcrypt.net/information/password-generator/'&gt;strong, unique passwords&lt;/a&gt; is one of the easiest ways to protect your accounts and data. Make sure to use a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters, and avoid using personal information or dictionary words. Still the most common password is still â€œ123456â€, so it's important to be creative and not use easily guessable passwords. It's also a good idea to use different passwords for different accounts to reduce the risk of all of your accounts being compromised if one password is exposed.</value>

  <data name="Blog_ASTSHSA_H2_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>A &lt;a href='https://axcrypt.net/passwordmanager/'&gt;password manager&lt;/a&gt; is a tool that generates and stores strong, unique passwords, helps you avoid using weak passwords, and makes it easier to use different passwords for different accounts. It also securely stores and organizes your passwords and may offer additional features such as two-factor authentication and alerts for exposed passwords. A password manager is a convenient and secure way to manage passwords. One option is AxCrypt which offers a password manager as part of its security solution.</value>

    <value>It's important to keep your software and operating system up to date to ensure that you have the latest security fixes. Hackers often target outdated systems, so make sure to regularly check for updates and install them when they are available. This includes your operating system, as well as any software that you use, such as your web browser, antivirus program, and office suite.</value>

    <value>Consider using a security solution like AxCrypt to encrypt your files and protect them with a password. This can help prevent unauthorized access to your data and give you peace of mind. Encrypting your files ensures that even if someone gains access to them, they will not be able to read or use the data without the password.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ASTSHSA_H5_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Accidents happen, and it's always a good idea to have a backup of your important files. Make sure to regularly back up your data to a secure location, such as an external hard drive or a cloud storage service. This can help protect against data loss in the event of a system failure or other unforeseen event. It's also a good idea to test your backups regularly to ensure that they are working properly.</value>

  <data name="Blog_ASTSHSA_H6_Text6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Public Wi-Fi networks can be vulnerable to hackers, so it's best to avoid accessing sensitive information or logging into important accounts while using them. If you need to use public Wi-Fi, make sure to use a reputable VPN service to secure your connection. A VPN, or virtual private network, encrypts your internet connection and helps protect your data from being accessed by others on the same network.</value>

    <value>&lt;strong&gt;Steps on How to Encrypt Files on Your Windows&lt;/strong&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_BAFESFW_H1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>File encryption is a process where individual files are secured by a file encryption software, by scrambling and rearranging the file’s data. This makes the file unreadable and inaccessible to unauthorized parties, without the appropriate decryption key.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_BAFESFW_H1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>During the process, the encryption software runs the files through a strong encryption algorithm such as &lt;b&gt;AES&lt;/b&gt;,which uses complex mathematical operations to scramble and rearrange the contents of the files. The scrambling process may involve several intricate &lt;a href='https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/projects/cryptographic-standards-and-guidelines/documents/aes-development/rijndael-ammended.pdf'&gt;&lt;b&gt;operations&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;b&gt;substitution&lt;/b&gt; (replacement) of text, &lt;b&gt;permutation&lt;/b&gt; (shuffling), and &lt;b&gt;bitwise&lt;/b&gt; logical operations such as XOR and shifting.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_BAFESFW_H1_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Depending on the algorithm, the operations can run for several rounds based on the round-key size. &lt;b&gt;AES&lt;/b&gt; utilizes &lt;b&gt;10, 12, or 14&lt;/b&gt; rounds based on the chosen key size. Each round applies and reiterates a series of operations to further obfuscate the file's data, enhancing its security.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_BAFESFW_H1_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>When you encrypt a file, the encryption software generates a unique encryption &lt;b&gt;key&lt;/b&gt;, which serves as the secret code needed to unlock and decrypt the file. This key is typically derived from a &lt;b&gt;password or passphrase&lt;/b&gt; that you choose during the encryption process.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_BAFESFW_H1_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Once your files are encrypted, they can be &lt;b&gt;safely stored, shared, or transmitted&lt;/b&gt; without the fear of unauthorized access. Even if someone gains access to your encrypted files, they will be unable to decipher the content without the encryption key.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_BAFESFW_H1_Text6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Automatic file encryption takes the process a step further by eliminating the need for manual encryption each time you create or modify a file. With the help of &lt;a href='https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-encryption-software'&gt;&lt;b&gt;AxCrypt&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you can set up automatic encryption rules that apply encryption to specific folders or subfolders. This means that any new files or modifications made to the designated folders will be automatically encrypted, providing continuous protection without any extra effort on your part while you continue to work on the file.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_BAFESFW_H2_SH2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;⏰ &lt;b&gt;Time and Effort Saving:&lt;/b&gt; By setting up automatic encryption rules, you eliminate the need to manually encrypt each file. This saves you valuable time and effort, especially when dealing with a &lt;b&gt;large number&lt;/b&gt; of files or &lt;b&gt;frequent modifications&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_BAFESFW_H2_SH2_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;📂 &lt;b&gt;Simplified File Management:&lt;/b&gt; AxCrypt's automatic encryption feature simplifies file management by applying encryption to specific folders or subfolders. This ensures that all files within the designated folders are automatically encrypted, reducing the risk of &lt;b&gt;human error&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;accidental exposure&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_BAFESFW_H2_SH2_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;🔒 &lt;b&gt;Enhanced Data Security:&lt;/b&gt; Automatic encryption ensures that your sensitive files are protected from unauthorized access. By encrypting them, you add an extra layer of security, safeguarding your data even if it falls into the wrong hands.&lt;/li&gt;</value>

    <value>Choosing AxCrypt</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_BESFBDTUG_Conclusion_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>AxCrypt is an award winning file encryption software available for Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android devices. Consistently for &lt;b&gt;six years&lt;/b&gt; in a row, AxCrypt has been awarded as the “Best Encryption Software” by PC Mag since &lt;b&gt;2016.&lt;/b&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_BESFBDTUG_Conclusion_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>AxCrypt is an excellent choice for business and organizations looking for a comprehensive and robust encryption software. It utilizes the superior &lt;b&gt;AES 256&lt;/b&gt; algorithm to secure business data, and comes with several unique features such as &lt;b&gt;automatic cloud encryption, secure file sharing, password management and generation&lt;/b&gt;, and a &lt;b&gt;master key&lt;/b&gt; to manage administrative encryption and decrypt subordinate accounts.</value>

  </data>
  <data name="Blog_BESFBDTUG_H1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Encryption is a process that protects your &lt;b&gt;sensitive&lt;/b&gt; business data and individual files by &lt;b&gt;transforming&lt;/b&gt; the contents of the files into unreadable format, using complex algorithms. This ensures that even if unauthorized individuals gain access to your data, they won't be able to understand or exploit it.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_BESFBDTUG_H1_Text10" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;👥 Secure Collaboration: Encrypted files enable safe collaboration and sharing, restricting access to authorized individuals.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_BESFBDTUG_H1_Text11" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;🛡️ Data Breach Shield: Encryption reduces the risk of data breaches by rendering the stolen or compromised data unreadable to cyber attackers. Even if a breach occurs, encrypted data is essentially useless to attackers, helping to mitigate potential damage and avoid financial consequences.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_BESFBDTUG_H1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The encryption process essentially involves three key components to encrypt data:</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_BESFBDTUG_H1_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;The plaintext,&lt;/b&gt; which refers to the original unencrypted data or file.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_BESFBDTUG_H1_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt; An &lt;b&gt;encryption algorithm&lt;/b&gt; like &lt;b&gt;AES&lt;/b&gt;, which uses complex mathematical functions to rearrange and jumble the contents of the original file or data.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_BESFBDTUG_H1_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;Cryptographic keys,&lt;/b&gt; which are unique keys with specific patterns used to encrypt and decrypt files. These keys enable the encryption process to be reversed, allowing authorized individuals to read the data. Think of them as the unique keys for your house or car door.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_BESFBDTUG_H1_Text6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Once the files are encrypted, users can decrypt them with a specified decryption key that is tied to the particular file. Users can then view, edit, and modify those files, and re-encrypt them after the modification process.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_BESFBDTUG_H1_Text7" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Encrypting your business data offers several core benefits that can provide peace of mind and ensure a business’s security is at the priority:</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_BESFBDTUG_H1_Text8" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;🔄 Seamless Workflows: Automatic encryption streamlines workflows by automatically securing new and modified files. Employees can work on encrypted files without disruptions, enhancing productivity and data security.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_BESFBDTUG_H1_Text9" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;✅ Compliance with Regulations: Encryption helps meet data protection requirements across different regulations and ensures legal compliance.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_BESFBDTUG_H2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>AxCrypt deploys the powerful &lt;b&gt;AES-256&lt;/b&gt; encryption algorithm to encrypt and secure business data. It can encrypt files on various devices, such as desktops, laptops, smartphones, and on cloud services like OneDrive and Google Drive.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_BESFBDTUG_H2_Text10" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;STEP 7:&lt;/b&gt; Create, modify, add, or drag files to the secured folder and AxCrypt will automatically encrypt them after clicking the &lt;b&gt;‘Cleanup’&lt;/b&gt; button on the &lt;b&gt;top-right&lt;/b&gt; or signing out of the application</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_BESFBDTUG_H2_Text11" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Your recently encrypted files will appear on the &lt;b&gt;‘Recent Files’&lt;/b&gt; tab, and will have a file extension of &lt;b&gt;.axx&lt;/b&gt;. Enlist new folders and subfolders and AxCrypt will automatically encrypt the files within them.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_BESFBDTUG_H2_Text12" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>To completely decrypt a file, click the &lt;b&gt;‘Stop Securing’&lt;/b&gt; button from the main menu strip on top and select the files that you’d like to decrypt.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_BESFBDTUG_H2_Text13" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>With &lt;a href='https://axcrypt.net/information/master-key/'&gt;&lt;b&gt;AxCrypt's Master Key&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; feature, employers and managers can easily manage individual licenses and access encrypted accounts with a single click. The Master Key can decrypt any encrypted file within subordinate accounts and provides the ability to limit or revoke access to those accounts. This ensures that files can be decrypted in cases of key loss, employee departure, or credential loss.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_BESFBDTUG_H2_Text14" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>For example, let's consider a scenario where the yearly revenue report, created by the previous financial team, was encrypted with credentials that are now unavailable to the new team. The new financial team could not access the report when they needed it for the annual analysis.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_BESFBDTUG_H2_Text15" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>This is where the Master Key feature comes to the rescue. With the Master Key, authorized personnel or administrators can regain access to encrypted files, even if the original credentials are no longer available.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_BESFBDTUG_H2_Text16" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>It provides a &lt;b&gt;centralized management&lt;/b&gt; capability, allowing for the decryption of files within subordinate accounts and the ability to control access permissions. This ensures that essential documents can be decrypted and accessed when needed, despite changes in team members or credentials.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_BESFBDTUG_H2_Text17" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Businesses can leverage AxCrypt’s Master Key functionality to gain control over their encrypted files and prevent any potential data access roadblocks caused by personnel changes or lost credentials. This adds an extra layer of flexibility to the encryption process.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_BESFBDTUG_H2_Text18" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The Master Key feature is available to AxCrypt Business users, and can be enabled from the My AxCrypt ID backend by signing in to &lt;a href='https://account.axcrypt.net/en'&gt;&lt;b&gt;account.axcrypt.net/en&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and selecting &lt;b&gt;Business Subscription &gt; Manage,&lt;/b&gt; and scrolling down for the Master Key option.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_BESFBDTUG_H2_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>With AxCrypt, businesses can set up automatic encryption for files within folders and subfolders, and collaborate on those files in &lt;b&gt;real time&lt;/b&gt;. Businesses can also enable automatic encryption for files on cloud services, and ensure a comprehensive data protection mechanism across devices.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_BESFBDTUG_H2_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Here’s how to encrypt business data automatically within just a few steps, using AxCrypt’s encryption software:</value>

  </data>
  <data name="Blog_BESFBDTUG_H2_Text7" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;STEP 4:&lt;/b&gt; This will encrypt the file and you can open it by either &lt;b&gt;double-clicking&lt;/b&gt; the file on the &lt;b&gt;‘Recent Files’&lt;/b&gt; tab or by clicking on &lt;b&gt;‘Open Secured’&lt;/b&gt; and selecting the file.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_BESFBDTUG_H2_Text8" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;STEP 5:&lt;/b&gt; To automatically encrypt, click on the &lt;b&gt;File &gt; Options&lt;/b&gt; and check the &lt;b&gt;‘Include Subfolders’&lt;/b&gt; option.</value>

This means that &lt;b&gt;8 out of 10&lt;/b&gt; data breaches were caused by human errors, including susceptible phishing attacks, accidental emailing, and social engineering.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_BESFBDTUG_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Small and medium-sized businesses &lt;b&gt;(SMBs)&lt;/b&gt; and enterprises are particularly vulnerable to cyber threats. Small businesses account for over &lt;a href='https://grow.exim.gov/blog/cybersecurity'&gt;&lt;b&gt;42% of all data breaches,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and an alarming &lt;a href='https://www.hivesystems.io/blog/60-of-small-businesses-close-within-six-months-of-a-cyber-attack'&gt;&lt;b&gt;60% of small businesses shut down&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;within &lt;b&gt;6 months&lt;/b&gt; of a cyber attack. It becomes beyond imperative for businesses to prioritize the security of their sensitive data with proven cybersecurity practices.</value>

Managing who has access to which accounts can be difficult for many firms, especially when numerous personnel require access to a single account. You may effectively manage and modify the password with the aid of a password manager.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_BMYP_H1_SH2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The fact that you don't need to have an excellent memory is the real advantage of using a password manager to increase your online security. This implies that everyone can apply the most recent password security advice.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_BMYP_H1_SH3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>People would like not having to remember long passwords that include symbols, numbers, punctuation, and capital letters, as well as other security password requirements. Additionally, they are permitted to employ complex passwords that are unique for each access point.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_BMYP_H1_SH4_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Password managers enable users to type, remember, and have the username and password for every access point filled in automatically.

  <data name="Blog_BMYP_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Security concerns are frequently of the utmost importance in an age where cybercrime is the most prevalent vice. People from many walks of life are working hard to discover solutions that not only offer the finest protection but also easy-to-use techniques in response to data breaches and other concerns. Despite repeated recommendations against using overly simple passwords or recycling the same password, a recent Pew Research Center survey found that people are still at risk of damaging personal data breaches that could result in identity or financial theft due to poor password management and a lack of digital security practices.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_BMYP_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The majority of people have confirmed that they frequently use passwords that are identical to or strikingly similar to one another. Others acknowledge employing short, uncomplicated passwords that are simple to remember. The best way to remember passwords is to memorize them, followed by the conventional pen and paper method of noting essential things in the diary. Simple passwords or even ones that are similar can be quickly guessed, and writing them down in a journal makes things worse because they can be easily stolen. One of Axcrypt's key features, a password manager, may be the solution to your cyber security worries.</value>

    <value>Benefits Of Managing Your Passwords</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_BSOHDGE_H1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Encryption is a technique that transforms plain text into an unreadable form called &lt;strong&gt;ciphertext. &lt;/strong&gt;This is achieved by running the text through an encryption algorithm, like &lt;strong&gt;AES,&lt;/strong&gt; which randomly rearranges and jumbles up the content, rendering it incomprehensible during transmission. </value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_BSOHDGE_H1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The process of rearranging the text is supported by complex mathematical calculations referred to as a &lt;strong&gt;‘key.’&lt;/strong&gt; These same mathematical calculations are also used for decryption, which reverses the encryption process and permits only authorized individuals to access the original plain text. </value>

    <value>Encryption utilizes intricate mathematical procedures called &lt;a href='https://axcrypt.net/blog/how-to-choose-the-right-encryption-algorithm-for-your-sensitive-data/'&gt;&lt;strong&gt; 'encryption algorithms'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; along with digital keys to scramble data. These encryption keys can be produced either manually or by software that applies an algorithm to scramble data and create a unique encryption key. </value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_BSOHDGE_H2_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Scrambling of the text occurs by encryption algorithm &lt;strong&gt;(cipher),&lt;/strong&gt; when it uses the encryption key to apply the conversion of data based on the mathematical equations of key, to turn it into ciphertext. This ciphertext can then be transmitted to a recipient and decoded back into the original value using the same or different cipher and key. </value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_BSOHDGE_H2_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>This is a very important element in terms of data security, as it guarantees that no one else would be able to read or decipher your data during its transmission – ensuring privacy and security of the sensitive information. </value>

    <value>A rudimentary encryption technique involves swapping each letter with its opposite position in the alphabet, such as &lt;strong&gt;“a”&lt;/strong&gt; is replaced with &lt;strong&gt;“z”,&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;“b”&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;“y”&lt;/strong&gt; and so on. An example of this is the phrase &lt;strong&gt;“AxCrypt Software”&lt;/strong&gt; resulting in an encrypted string using the letter-swapping technique as &lt;strong&gt;“ZwBqxos Rnesvzqd”.&lt;/strong&gt;</value>

    <value>With the advent of &lt;strong&gt;Industry 4.0&lt;/strong&gt; and technologies like AI and ML, it has become even more important to safeguard your sensitive data. According to a &lt;a href='https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/04/how-much-data-is-generated-each-day-cf4bddf29f'&gt;World Economic Forum (WRF) report,&lt;/a&gt;  by &lt;strong&gt;2025,&lt;/strong&gt; the amount of data generated in the cloud servers &lt;strong&gt;each day&lt;/strong&gt;  will reach around &lt;strong&gt;463 exabytes&lt;/strong&gt; globally. This is an astonishingly enormous amount data generated within just a day, which also increases the chances of data attacks and data breaches. </value>

    <value>Use a virtual private network (VPN). VPNs are used to protect private web traffic from snooping, interference, and censorship. PNs encrypt all the data you send over the internet. Your VPN also masks your IP address and finally some VPNs block malicious websites, ads, and trackers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</value>

    <value>Strong passwords are the key to your digital life. Passwords are the digital keys to our networks of friends, our work colleagues, and even our banking and payment services. The most important two passwords are those for your email and social network accounts. It’s important to use entirely new and unique passwords for each account you might run, so you avoid compromising your data if one of your accounts gets hacked. To have a strong password it is extremely important not to include any personal information in your passwords. Hackers could attempt to log on to your account by guessing your password based off of personal information gained from your security questions. The shorter and less complex your password is, the quicker it can be to come up with the correct combination of characters and access your private information. A password cracker is a programme using a multitude of combinations in a very small amount of time until gaining full access to whatever your password was protecting. Use a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, symbols and numbers.</value>

    <value>End-to-end encryption gives you back control and protects your data from snoopers and prying eyes. Encryption is the best working way so far to secure your data of any form of unwanted access. By taking plain text and using mathematical calculations to turn data into code it is converted into cipher text, only those who have the special key can decrypt your files.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</value>

    <value>Premium and business customers have access to our extra strong encryption method: AES-256. The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 256 is adopted by federal agencies like the National Security Agency (NSA) where national security is involved. AES-256  is the strongest, most secure and most efficient encryption algorithm available nowadays. AES uses symmetric key encryption: one secret key is used to cipher and decipher. Symmetric keys are better suited to internal encryption, faster and in need of less computational power it is therefore an effective mechanism. The plaintext, which is the information to be encrypted, is divided into sections of 256-bit block size after a few rounds of substitutions, permutations and linear transformations the data is transformed into code. The size of the encrypted data remains the same: 256 bits of plaintext yields 256 bits of ciphertext.</value>

    <value>&lt;h3&gt;Some Characteristics of the Cloud&lt;/h3&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CEANK_H1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The cloud is a network that refers to all the data servers that are placed all over the world including their software and database sometimes operated offshore. It permits users to access the same files or applications anywhere at any time via the Internet as the information is stored on the servers instead of local devices such as computers or phones. The files are moreover stored various times on distinct data centers so that the information remains available if any problem should occur. Over time, businesses switched to cloud computing removing in that way some costs and the endeavor of taking care and maintaining their own servers.This convenient, on-demand network does not crack, gets lost or stolen. The cloud is a promising technology that enables collaboration, flexibility, reliability and high productivity.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CEANK_H2_SH1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Providers rent out basic storage capacity on virtual servers according to their need instead of buying an expensive hardware. Exemples for that can be SaaS applications including Salesforce, MailChimp, and Slack. SaaS is like renting a house: the landlord maintains the house, but the tenant mostly gets to use it.&lt;br/&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CEANK_H2_SH2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Businesses pay for development tools, infrastructure and operating systems they need to to build their own application to then upload it on their devices. Heroku and Microsoft Azure belong to the PaaS categorie. PaaS can be compared to renting all the tools and equipment necessary for building a house.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CEANK_H2_SH3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In this model, a company rents the servers and storage they need from a cloud provider. They then use that cloud infrastructure to build their applications. IaaS providers include DigitalOcean, Google Compute Engine, and OpenStack. IaaS is like a company leasing a plot of land.</value>

    <value>Personal data is any information relating to an identifiable person. Examples for that could be name, address, occupation, income, political opinions, healthcare information and IP address of course.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CEANK_H4_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Our Swedish company takes privacy law as a matter of hearth. Business or private customers have the right to ask about the level of privacy your personal data has when stored in the cloud. Moreover if you work and deal with data of European citizens, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) comes into effect and therefore it is important to be well informed. The GDPR is clearly in favour of encryption as the European Commission conferred that data protection outside the EU is not effective enough, Switzerland is nevertheless a rare exception. The US politic through data protection is a political subject that divides the population. Because of the Patriot Act, authorities have the right to inspect intensively personal data without even a court order. Problem is then that most of the cloud providers companies such as Dropbox, Microsoft, or Google are affiliated on US ground.</value>

  <data name="Blog_CEMDWYRNTK_H1_Text22" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;AES-256 Encryption&lt;/b&gt; - AES-256 encryption is a form of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) that uses a 256-bit key to encrypt and decrypt data. This is the most robust encryption service on the market.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CEMDWYRNTK_H1_Text23" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;Symmetric Key Encryption&lt;/b&gt; - AxCrypt utilizes symmetric key encryption, meaning that the same password (key) is required to both encrypt and decrypt files.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CEMDWYRNTK_H1_Text24" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;Password management&lt;/b&gt; - AxCrypt’s Password Management service significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access to your online accounts.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CEMDWYRNTK_H1_Text25" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;Integrated Key Management&lt;/b&gt; - AxCrypt also offers a key management feature, where users can securely share encrypted files with others by managing keys within the software.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CEMDWYRNTK_H1_Text26" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;Myth 8: Encryption Slows Down Systems Significantly&lt;/b&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CEMDWYRNTK_H1_Text27" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>While encryption does add some processing overhead, modern encryption services like AxCrypt are designed to handle it efficiently. The impact of AxCrypt on performance is minimal and often unnoticeable.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CEMDWYRNTK_H1_Text28" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;Myth 9: Encryption is Only Necessary for Sensitive Information&lt;/b&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CEMDWYRNTK_H1_Text29" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>This myth leads to the assumption that only things like financial data or personal identity information need to be encrypted.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CEMDWYRNTK_H1_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>AxCrypt has a comprehensive protection for businesses. AxCrypt’s business plan is tailored for companies of all sizes, ensuring that even SMBs can prevent data breaches.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CEMDWYRNTK_H1_Text30" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The fact is that by keeping all data encrypted, sensitive information will be kept even safer. Seemingly non-sensitive information can be valuable to attackers, and data breaches of non-sensitive information can be used to commit an attack on sensitive data.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CEMDWYRNTK_H1_Text31" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;Myth 10: You Don’t Need to Encrypt Data Stored in the Cloud&lt;/b&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CEMDWYRNTK_H1_Text32" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Some believe that cloud service providers will handle all aspects of security, including encryption. While some providers do offer encryption most of them don’t have complete protection.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CEMDWYRNTK_H1_Text33" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>AxCrypt has been vocal in debunking this myth. This misconception may be dangerous since cloud software services often give the impression of being a completely secure option. That’s why AxCrypt has been outspoken about this issue and has ensured synchronization with all major cloud software services (OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.).</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CEMDWYRNTK_H1_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;Myth 2: A good password is enough&lt;/b&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CEMDWYRNTK_H1_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>While strong passwords are important, relying solely on a password, even a complex one, leaves your data vulnerable. Hackers continuously develop new methods to crack passwords, making it crucial to implement a multi-layered defence strategy. Two-factor authentication, encryption, and regular updates are essential to safeguarding your information.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CEMDWYRNTK_H1_Text6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Beyond just managing passwords, AxCrypt encrypts all your files, securing your information in the cloud and on your devices—even if your passwords are compromised.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CEMDWYRNTK_H1_Text7" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;Myth 3: You’ll know immediately if your computer is compromised&lt;/b&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CEMDWYRNTK_H1_Text8" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Many people believe that they will recognize the signs of a cyberattack as soon as it occurs. However, modern malware is often designed to be stealthy, operating undetected for extended periods. This delay increases the potential damage as sensitive data can be compromised without your knowledge.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CEMDWYRNTK_H1_Text9" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>This is what we call peace of mind with file encryption. Cyberattacks may be hard to stop, but with AxCrypt, your data remains safe regardless of what happens to your devices.</value>

However, many myths about encryption are not beneficial; in fact, they can be rather dangerous and devastating. Today, we put our most important data and personal information into our tiny devices, assuming it will stay safe there. We use these same devices to keep in contact with people in every aspect of our lives, often connecting them to WiFi networks without knowing whether they are safe or not.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CEMDWYRNTK_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Given our dependence on these devices, it’s even more important for people to navigate this digital age with caution. Unfortunately, many of the myths circulating about encryption result in less precaution being taken. Some may avoid using encryption, thinking it’s too complex, or believe that storing everything in the cloud will keep it safe. Not true!</value>

    <value>Some of the issues that cyber hygiene is intended to solve are as follows:</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CHHSSO_H2_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;Data breaches include risks from hackers, phishing, malware, and viruses.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CHHSSO_H2_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;Data loss — unbacked-up hard drives and online cloud storage might be exposed to hacking, damage, or other issues that result in data loss.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CHHSSO_H2_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;Out-of-date software can make your device more vulnerable to cyber threats.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CHHSSO_H2_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;Older antivirus – security software that hasn't been maintained up to date will be less effective at defending you from the most recent cyber dangers.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CHHSSO_H3_SH1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Antivirus scanning regularly can help in the prevention of problems. Files will be protected from persistent internet threats if they are correctly maintained. This will also prevent files from fragmenting and resulting in data loss.</value>

    <value>&lt;a href='https://axcrypt.net/blog/encryption-software/'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Encryption&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; transforms plain text into ciphertext or converts readable text into unreadable text to protect data so that only certain people can access it. Encryption scrambles or encrypts data and then utilizes a key to unscramble or decrypt the information for the receiving party. It proves to be a successful method of safeguarding sensitive data. Data on computers and storage devices and data in transit through networks are all protected with encryption.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CHHSSO_H3_SH3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>It is essential to have secure passwords for all of your devices. Your passwords should be unique and complicated, with at least 12 characters, including numbers, capital, lowercase letters, and symbols. Changing your passwords regularly — will help keep hackers at bay. AxCrypt provides a password management generator that ensures their passwords are strong and secure.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CHHSSO_H3_SH4_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Backups should be kept in a distinct location from the originals and tested regularly. To securely save personal files, create a backup on a separate device (e.g., the cloud or an encrypted USB). You can encrypt your drive data with AxCrypt, which encrypts data in transit, rest, and storage. In addition, you retain control over your encryption keys, allowing you to keep command even after data has left your building.</value>

    <value>&lt;strong&gt;Five key pillars of cyber resilience:&lt;/strong&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CRI_H1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>It is crucial for an organization to create a more robust cyber strategy to resist the flood of threats and attacks from all over the world. Cyber resilience is the capacity to foresee, tolerate, and recover from any cyberthreats and data breaches. They also control system attacks through online resources. The main aim of cyber resilience is to secure organizational functionality and endure all the crises, dangers, adversities, emergencies and difficulties that are both known and unforeseen. Cyber resilience is a new security paradigm that stimulates a proactive security strategy including planning, responding, and recovering from cyber-attacks without affecting regular business operations, business continuity and business acceleration.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CRI_H2_SH1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;strong&gt;Augmented Systems Security:&lt;/strong&gt;Cyber ​​resilience is not only used for responding to and surviving an attack, but also helps in developing strategies for improvising IT governance, critical asset security and data privacy. Resilience also helps in avoiding the various outcomes faced due to natural disasters or reducing human error.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CRI_H2_SH1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;strong&gt;Minimal Financial Loss:&lt;/strong&gt;One of the main advantages of cyber resilience is decreased downtime and financial losses. Cyber resilience provides a plan which helps minimize business disruption and hence reduce financial losses in a timely and accurate manner.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CRI_H2_SH1_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;strong&gt;Swift Recovery Time:&lt;/strong&gt;Apart from these, cyber resilience also accelerates the recovery process, supporting you to get your business back up and running as quickly as possible.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CRI_H2_SH1_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;strong&gt;Reputation Protection:&lt;/strong&gt;Each employee is liable for protecting sensitive data and hard assets of the organization, ensuring an appropriate incident response, in turn reducing the risk factors. Poor cyber resilience can irreversibly damage an organization's reputation.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CRI_H2_SH1_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;strong&gt;Better IT Team:&lt;/strong&gt;Cyber resilience improves IT department operations, enabling them to respond to threats and helping them to run daily operations smoothly.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CRI_H2_SH1_Text6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;strong&gt;Improved Customer Confidence:&lt;/strong&gt;Cyber incidents damage a company’s reputation. Cyber resilience can reassure customer confidence by providing the assurance of keeping their data secured. This increases customer confidence and in turn increases the sales of the organization.</value>

  <data name="Blog_CRI_H2_SubHeading1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;strong&gt;Benefits of having Cyber Resilience&lt;/strong&gt;:</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CRI_H2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Nowadays the security environment is changing persistently. Organizations and individuals are targeted by hackers and disasters and hence it is a major aspect to keep the data and credentials cyber-safe. Cyber security is the best way to achieve business continuity. Implementing resilience of the information architecture of an organization reduces the likelihood of an attack, in turn minimizing and reducing the damage. Cyber resilience not only reduces existing threats but also lowers long-term threats from various hi-tech technologies like artificial intelligence, quantum computing, memcomputing or IoT.</value>

    <value>In today's modern world, cyberattacks like malware, phishing, password and SQL injection attacks have increased enormously. The main target of hackers is stealing or deleting confidential data from a computer network, database, or personal devices. According to Cybersecurity Ventures, it is said, by 2025 cybercrime will cost the global economy $10.5 trillion every year. And it is very vital to develop a strong reaction to this issue given the scope of this criminal conduct. Cyber-attacks are so crucial that they can disable, destroy or disrupt computer systems. They can even control the entire system and can change, modify, block, erase, or steal the data stored within. Normally created and initiated by a person or group using one or more attack tactics via the internet.</value>

    <value>Perhaps the biggest vulnerabilities that public key cryptography faces are people accidentally losing their keys or revealing their private key to other people.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CWELTI_Conclusion_H1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>First of all, a person should never share his or private key information with anyone. Hardware wallets can add an extra layer of security. It completely removes one's cryptocurrencies from the internet for storage in a similar way that flash drives remove information from a computer for storage off of the computer. Companies also sell insurances helping cryptocurrency holders from experiencing major losses if a cryptocurrency exchange is hacked.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CWELTI_Conclusion_H1_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>However, because technology tends to improve over time, it is possible that someone could invent a system that is even better than public key cryptography. If this happens, then many of the main cryptocurrencies will probably be updated to incorporate the developments. This could make cryptocurrencies even more secure, hypothetically.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CWELTI_Conclusion_H1_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>As more and more people start to use cryptocurrencies, a larger percentage of the population will start to understand just how valuable public key cryptography and cryptocurrencies are. Part of the reason why all of this cryptography technology is being developed is because there is an increased need to store, send, and receive money securely on the internet. Online banking and ecommerce are driving this need. Business and banking are both more efficient when money can safely be transferred online. Public key cryptography is doing a lot to make digital money exchanging and storing safer. Because public key cryptography and cryptocurrencies are helping to improve digital money use and storage, it is very likely that cryptocurrencies will continue to rise in popularity significantly over the next few decades.</value>

    <value>How to protect your private key?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CWELTI_H1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>A cryptocurrency, or crypto, is decentralized digital money based on blockchain technology. A digital asset based on a network that is distributed across a large number of computers, cryptocurrency is secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. It can be used as a form of payment to buy goods and services, but also as an investment. As this type of currency is unregulated, buyers like to trade it for profit as they would in other assets like stocks and precious metals.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CWELTI_H2_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>There is no central authority that fixes and maintains the value of crypto. It is a medium of exchange that is digital, encrypted and decentralized. That cryptographic proof comes in the form of transactions that are verified and recorded in a form of program called a blockchain. More than 6,700 different cryptocurrencies are traded publicly, the most popular being Bitcoin and Ethereum. Most supporters of crypto like the fact that these currencies, apart from being decentralized and more secured throughout the process of blockchain, remove central banks from managing the money supply securing it from government interference and manipulation. Many companies have issued their own currencies, often called tokens, and these can be traded specifically for the good or service that the company provides.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CWELTI_H3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>A blockchain is an open, distributed ledger that records transactions in code enforced by a disparate network of computers. Blockchains are organizational methods for ensuring the integrity of transactional data and play a major role within cryptocurrency exchanges.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CWELTI_H3_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>A database is a collection of information that is stored electronically on a computer system. Data needs to be structured, and if needed, filtered, to find specific information.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CWELTI_H3_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Blockchains differ from specific databases, where data is stored in blocks and chained together. As new data comes in it is entered into a fresh block. Once the block is filled with data it is chained onto the previous block, which chains the data together in chronological order.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CWELTI_H3_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Different types of information can be stored on a blockchain but the most common use so far has been as a ledger for transactions. In Bitcoin's case, blockchain is used in a decentralized way so that no single person or group has control. Rather, all users collectively retain control. Decentralized blockchains are immutable, which means that the data entered is irreversible. For Bitcoin, this means that transactions are permanently recorded and viewable to anyone.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CWELTI_H4_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>One of the advantages of cryptocurrency is that the transfers are made easy and exclude the use of a third party such as a bank or credit card company. The exchanges are secured and ensured by public or private keys. On the other hand, a significant disadvantage would be money laundering and tax evasion, making crypto transactions well suited for illegal activities.</value>

    <value>Cryptography implies the use of different encryption techniques which are used to secure a network. It is essentially the practice of encrypting certain data or information so that it can be kept secret from third parties. By converting your private information into a secret code that hides the information's true meaning, you make it almost impossible for an intruder to decrypt it into plaintext. When an encrypted message is intercepted by an unauthorized entity, the inflator has to guess the variables that were used to encrypt the message. The time and difficulty of guessing this information is what makes encryption such a valuable security tool.</value>

    <value>Cryptocurrencies use cryptography for three main purposes: to secure transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets. To accomplish all of these things, cryptocurrencies rely on what is called "public key cryptography".</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CWELTI_H6_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The various encryption algorithms and cryptographic techniques that safeguard the specific entries are for example elliptical curve encryption, public-private key pairs, and hashing functions.</value>

    <value>Public keys give an address to people on where to send the money to. It involves a user having both a public and private key, encrypted in an assortment of around 30 numbers and letters. The purpose of the private key is to unlock the public key in order to receive the money that has been sent. In this way, only the person who knows the private key can unlock the public key. Anyone can deposit money to a public key/address, but only people with the private key can access the money. This allows people to receive money without other people being able to access the money. Public key cryptography is a technological wonder and it is rapidly changing the online payment industry.</value>

  <data name="Blog_DEVFE_Conclusion_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The whole world has become internet-focused therefore, it is important to turn your attention towards data security. It is entirely up to you to determine which encryption approach is best for you.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_DEVFE_H1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Nowadays it's more important than ever to keep information safe in this internet-connected society. Your data, whether it's personal or professional, is constantly at risk of slipping into the wrong hands, which is all the more reason to use the finest encryption software available. Data encryption is a crucial component of safeguarding data. It is the process of scrambling text (called ciphertext) to make it unreadable to an unauthorized user at the most basic level. Encryption can be applied to individual files, folders, volumes, or whole drives on a computer or USB device, as well as information in the cloud.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_DEVFE_H1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Just as security tech is taking steps to increase the safety of your information, hackers are finding new ways around them as a result, to defeat them new encryption techniques are always being developed. Let’s dive into popular encryption methods, types, and how it can help you.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_DEVFE_H2_SH1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>A file or folder encryption system encrypts particular folders, files, or volumes. This enables users to control who gets access to what information. it's a way of preserving large amounts of data or protecting sensitive data not just over the internet, but also in transit, usage, and storage. Since file encryption uses fewer resources, it has a lower impact on system performance. A file-based encryption system is akin to a lockbox kept in a bank vault. Even if the vault is broken into, each box has its own layer of protection within that requires concentrated effort to break. Similarly, if your device is hacked, lost, or stolen, a third party will be unable to open your files and folders since each file is encrypted and no one will be able to access them without the key. AxCrypt is an example of a free open-source files/folder encryption software available for Windows, Android, iOS, and even macOS. AxCrypt makes data more secure whether it is being transported or at rest. Users can take full control of their data.&lt;br/&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_DEVFE_H2_SH2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Full disk encryption (FDE) is, as the name implies, encryption at the disk level. When data is written to or read from a disc, it is automatically encrypted. It encrypts all files on the hard drive, including the operating system and file system. It's only used to keep files safe while they're in storage or not in transit. Full disk encryption works in a similar way to locking a house's outer doors but not its internal rooms. Of course, it's a good idea to secure the front entrance so that attackers can't easily get access, but if they manage to enter, they'll have full access to everything inside. In the same way, disk encryption secures information as a whole by turning all of it into an unreadable code that is difficult for unauthorized individuals to understand.&lt;strong&gt;There are two main types of disk encryption, which we'll go over in detail below.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_DEVFE_H2_SH3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>BitLocker is a full-disk encryption technology included in the newest Windows operating systems (Windows 10) that encrypts data on hard drives using AES (128 and 256-bit) encryption. When BitLocker Drive Encryption is activated, and the user adds new files, BitLocker will encrypt them automatically. BitLocker with TPM protection prevents out-of-OS alteration of boot components by using the Static Root of Trust Measurement. BitLocker requires the user to enter a recovery key only when disk corruption occurs, or when he or she loses the PIN or password.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_DEVFE_H2_SH4_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>FileVault is a full disk encryption feature from Apple built into macOS. FileVault, like BitLocker for Windows, provides robust encryption for files and data on Mac computers, safeguarding the whole disk and all of the contents on it. When FileVault is turned on, it operates quietly in the background, encrypting all device data on the fly and without causing any interruptions.</value>

  </data>
  <data name="Blog_DEVFE_H3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Both BitLocker and FileVault are disk encryption software that functions in the same way but on different operating systems. Both are for safeguarding data on workstations and mobile devices at storage and are capable of encrypting entire hard drives,including both system and data drives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_DEVFE_H3_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>FileVault full-disk encryption (FileVault 2) uses XTS-AES-128 encryption with a 256-bit key to help prevent unauthorized access to the information on macOS. FileVault encodes the information stored on your Mac so that it can’t be read unless the login password is entered.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_DEVFE_H3_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>BitLocker supports encrypted hard drives with built-in encryption hardware, allowing administrators to manage them using the same BitLocker administration tools. File-based encryption is transparent encryption that fills in the gaps where full disk encryption falls short. When BitLocker is enabled on a system drive and the PC has a TPM, you can choose to require that users type a PIN before BitLocker will unlock the drive. With disk encryption, the data is only protected for as long as it’s on the disk; if a user removes a file from an encrypted device, that file is no longer secured. Furthermore, if the entire system is physically hacked, disk encryption is unreliable. As a result, for the vast majority of cases, the file-based encryption approach is the best option.</value>

    <value>AxCrypt works with file encryption and it's best for protecting data on cloud storage and when you like to share your encrypted data. AxCrypt uses 256-bit encryption to protect your data at all three phases of its lifecycle: at rest, in transit, and in use. AxCrypt allows secured files to be opened by other AxCrypt users with their own passwords and it's also easier to safeguard your online assets. AxCrypt automatically encrypts data on Google Drive, Dropbox, and other cloud storage providers.

    <value>AxCrypt offers strong encryption with 256-bit encryption to secure your data in the three stages of data; data at rest, at transit and in use. Moreover, AxCrypt also provides its users a password management generator that ensures your passwords are as secure as possible. Using the AxCrypt encryption software also provides a collaboration tool that allows users to share secured files and data with other AxCrypt users. Have a look at our &lt;a href='https://axcrypt.net/features/' style='color: #efefef; font-weight: 800;'&gt;Feature Page&lt;/a&gt; to find out more about how AxCrypt can secure your files and data and the &lt;a href='https://www.axcrypt.net/pricing' style='color: #efefef; font-weight: 800;'&gt;Pricing Page&lt;/a&gt; that shows which types of encryption subscriptions AxCrypt offers.</value>

  <data name="Blog_DRATIUIN_H1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Nowadays, data plays a very important role, especially for businesses and organizations. There are different types of data and the data can be outlined into different categories, such as financial data, statistical data or scientific data. Furthermore, data can be categorized into two different subcategories, structured and unstructured data. Structured data can be read and interpreted by humans, i.e. transactional data, personal data or web data, whereas unstructured data is data that computer programs process.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_DRATIUIN_H2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Data can be used in many different ways. For example, data collection can be especially beneficial for companies and organizations. The collection of data can be used to gain a better understanding of customers needs, behaviours and churn. The problem is that many firms have too much data and then have issues finding the right data to analyse. Furthermore, data can contain sensitive information that companies or individuals do not want to share with anyone else. Sensitive data that contains your important, private information should be encrypted at all times. Therefore, AxCrypt offers you features that secure your data. These features include, for instance, key sharing, a password manager, password generator and strong AES-256 encryption.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_DRATIUIN_H3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Data at rest, at transit and in use are part of the three states of data. The different states of data also show different issues of how data can be attacked by hackers. Data at rest is described as data that is not moving around, for instance, when data is stored on a laptop, hard drive, or flash drive. To protect data at rest, it is helpful and beneficial to use AxCrypt encryption. It will protect your stored data in various places, for example, on your computer, in the cloud with AxCrypt´s Cloud Storage awareness, and on your smartphone. If the data is left unprotected, hackers will be able to find a way to get to your data, because data in rest is usually considered to be more valuable than data in transit.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_DRATIUIN_H3_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Data at transit is constantly moving through the internet. This includes sending emails, uploading documents to a cloud and browsing the internet. In the transit phase, data is often less secure, making it easier for hackers to get access to your data. Therefore, using AxCrypt encryption is a major advantage when sending data from one network to another.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_DRATIUIN_H3_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Data in use refers to active data that is being processed by applications. In the data in use stage the data is more vulnerable and therefore many businesses and organizations are concerned because of the sensitive data that can be accessed by hackers if the data in use is not protected. Moreover, a major problem is that when hackers have access to the random access memory (RAM) it is easier for them to get access to the memory and therefore can decrypt encrypted data at rest. In order to protect data in use, it is important to encrypt the memory, but also to use tools that make sure only validated people can access the data</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_DRATIUIN_H4_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>There is a constant risk for sensitive data to be accessed by hackers. Whether the data is in transit, at rest or in use, it is important to protect the data. One way of making sure that this data does not get accessed by a hacker is Encryption. Encryption is essential to assure that sensitive data does not get stolen or intercepted by an outsider. More and more businesses and Organizations start encrypting their data before they move it from one network to another.  With AxCrypt's key sharing feature, you can allow your colleagues to open secured files with their own password.</value>

  <data name="Blog_EAB_H1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Quite frequently we get requests for integrating various forms of biometrics into AxCrypt instead of, or as complements to the password. The problem here is that properly designed encryption systems assume an attacker has huge resources and full knowledge of everything. Except one single piece of information: the decryption key. This is all that must be kept secret, and it must also be kept secret. Everything depends on this key being secret. In AxCrypt terms the password is ultimately the key that must be secret.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EAB_H1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>A fingerprint is unique, but it is not secret and it cannot be changed. It is entirely unsuitable to use directly or indirectly as an encryption key.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EAB_H1_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>It is possible to do what mobile device manufacturers do, to use internal trusted hardware as the guardian of the secret keys which will only release the secrets if authenticated by for example a fingerprint. This is how Apple Touch ID works. But, remember the caveats of biometric authentication mentioned above. The internal trusted hardware can always be fooled by a sufficiently well made device or artifact, and frequently the required fingerprint is even found all over the device itself!</value>

  <data name="Blog_EAB_Summary" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>There are several fundamental problems with using biometrics such as fingerprints, facial recognition etc for authentication. It’s even more problematic when encryption is involved. There are two major problems with using biometrics for authentication.</value>

  <data name="Blog_EAB_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;ol style='list-style-position: inside;display: grid;gap: 20%;'&gt;&lt;li&gt;If there is no other human actually watching you ‘apply’ the biometric, it’s really hard to ensure that the biometric is really attached to the real person. Think 3D-model of face, or chopped off thumb :-( .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can’t change your face or your fingerprint, and it’s not a secret, so once that knowledge is in the wrong hands it’s a technological arms race against physical and electronic spoofing devices such as fake thumbs or thumbprint reader bypass technology just to name a few. You’re for ever stuck with your face and your fingers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EAB_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>This makes it pretty clear that pure biometric authentication is only suitable when the asset being protected is of sufficiently low value that an attacker will not find the cost and risk of bypassing it worthwhile.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EAB_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The current trend of incorporating fingerprint authentication in mobile devices is troubling. The value represented by a modern mobile device, including the assets potentially reachable indirectly such as online accounts, could easily make spoofing worthwhile. In some parts of the world it does not require too much imagination to envision people being robbed not only of their phones as today, but of a fingertip at the same time tomorrow.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EAB_Text6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>We already have a situation where identity theft is a major headache. But this can actually be handled, even if the process is hampered by outdated systems and laws. If biometrics continue to gain headway, we may get a group of people who will never fully integrate into society since their biometrics once stolen can never by recovered or changed. The theft may occur individually, or from corporate or government databases.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EAB_Text7" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>While the likelyhood of a national or corporate fingerprint database leaking is perhaps low, it’s not zero. With time it will happen. Once it’s happened it can never be undone.</value>

    <value>In ransom attacks, hackers take a company's data then encrypt it so they can't access it anymore. Cybercriminals will then blackmail the firm by threatening to reveal its confidential information unless a ransom is paid. In 2017, ransomware attacks grew considerably. However, in the current environment, the threat of ransomware is becoming much more serious as technology advances.</value>

    <value>The first important future trend will be how user-controlled encryption—that is, systems in which consumers or end-users have complete control over the keys to encrypt and decode data—will be embraced across platforms and widely utilized applications, such as WhatsApp and Signal. The adoption of user-controlled encryption systems is one of the key things they're talking about in the context of “going dark”, and it's something that law enforcement is really interested in. User-controlled encryption will make accessing some data difficult or impossible for law enforcement. However, as the study points out, such encryption will not be employed everywhere since various users have different encryption demands and methodologies. The same may be said for service providers. Some clients want to know that their information will be safe even if their service provider is hacked encryption. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</value>

    <value>In the next few years, workstations that contain data that must be kept safe for lengthy periods of time after initial encryption will require post-quantum cryptography. Quantum computers are extremely difficult to construct. None has yet been constructed that can outperform a traditional computer, despite many attempts. But according to the article, quantum machines might become a reality within the next 10 to 20 years. Quantum cryptography, unlike mathematical encryption, employs quantum physics to convey secure data and is genuinely unhackable. Quantum cryptography is a quantum mechanics-based approach for safeguarding the distribution of symmetric encryption keys. Quantum key distribution is a more accurate term for it (QKD). The different QKD techniques are designed to ensure that any eavesdropper attempting to monitor the transmitted photons would cause the transmission to be disrupted.</value>

  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EHI_H1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>There have been plenty of high-profile data breaches in the healthcare industry over the past five years. Without getting into the nuance of each situation, the result has been hundreds of millions of patient records being compromised and potentially sold on the dark web. The Anthem incident in 2015 is just one example. .&lt;br/&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EHI_H1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The healthcare sector comprises not just hospitals and pharmacies, but also research centers and laboratories. All of them contain sensitive information on patients, medical reports, and data regarding medical research; for instance, Coronavirus studies and vaccines. As technology advances, cybercriminals become more sophisticated; sensitive information can fall into the wrong hands if it isn't adequately protected. Therefore, the need for encryption has become more prevalent in hospitals, nursing homes, and rehabilitation facilities. Healthcare organizations must establish comprehensive security measures to safeguard data from growing numbers of threats in order to properly secure delicate information from hackers.&lt;br/&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EHI_H2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Since the global pandemic, the healthcare industry experienced a 51% increase in the total volume of records exposed. In the first half of 2021, data breaches grew further; with the healthcare sector remaining at the top of the most-breached industry list.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EHI_H2_Text2" xml:space="preserve">

  <data name="Blog_EHI_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Healthcare is a global sector that continuously processes and transmits large volumes of vital information on a regular basis through a variety of channels and facilities. Due to the pandemic and growth in digitalization, healthcare data and practices have steadily adopted more electronic and automated formats. Every day, the amount of healthcare data transmitted and processed is calculated in terabytes.  As a result, healthcare data has become the main focus for security breaches and cybercrime.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EHI_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>According to a Stanford University white paper, medical data is growing at a rate of 48% each year. Private information on patients, their health state, and insurance providers that circulate in a hospital or doctor's office fall under this category. The patients' sensitive information requires a high level of protection.</value>

    <value>Encryption in the healthcare industry</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EIAWII_H1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>One aspect of the bill which has sparked significant uproar and critique is the eradication of Section 230 in regards to abusive material. Section 230 is a law which shields internet companies from being held liable for the content posted by their users. For example, if an individual user posts illegal content on Facebook, the owners of Facebook will not be held liable for this illegal act. Under the EARN IT Act, however, companies will no longer be subject to this protection.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EIAWII_H1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>As explained by the American Civil Liberties Union, companies will respond to the subsequent increase in the liability cost of providing an online service by passing this cost on to consumers. This will be materialised through increased surveillance and screening of private messages, in an attempt for companies to avoid expensive lawsuits. As a result, censorship is promoted and freedom of speech on the internet becomes limited.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EIAWII_H2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Another significant caveat to this bill is the necessary creation of backdoors. A backdoor when speaking about encryption is essentially a built-in feature which allows an agent to bypass the encryption. In this case, the backdoor feature will provide the government the ability to evade all security that an individual has placed on their device, enabling easy access to personal data.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EIAWII_H2_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>This act will impact all users of the internet within United States borders, irrespective of whether the government is interested in your data or not. When backdoors are introduced, ill-intentioned agents are also provided an opportunity to retrieve your data. As stated by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, “either the message remains private to everyone but its recipients, or it is available to others”.

    <value>The United States government and larger tech companies have long been in a standoff in regards to data privacy and the government’s right to access encrypted information. You may remember the dispute between Apple and the FBI in the San Bernardino case. Apple refused to create a backdoor for the federal agency, rendering it incredibly challenging for the FBI to access the shooter’s phone. Apple came to this conclusion as they felt creating a backdoor “would set a dangerous precedent” for the encrypted material of all iPhone users.</value>

    <value>Cryptography is the study of abstracting information from undesired users of the same. Cryptography techniques have long been used in the banking industries to ensure the security of monetary transactions including the security of ATM cards, computer passwords, and electronic commerce.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EIBM_H1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Cryptography revolves around Encryption and Decryption where Encryption is a process in which plain text data is converted into an unreadable text called the ciphertext and decryption is the process of transforming data that has been rendered unreadable back to its normal form.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EIBM_H1_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>When in the wrong hands, personal information can be wielded as a powerful tool. One of the best ways to protect your data is to encrypt it. End-to-end encryption gives you back control and protects your data from snoopers and prying eyes. Encryption is the best working way so far to secure your data of any form of unwanted access. By taking plain text and using mathematical calculations to turn data into code it is converted into cipher text, only those who have the special key can decrypt your files. Our user friendly system enables ease of operations, guarantees the highest possible control and ensures that nobody but you can access your personal information so that no disadvantageous data breach arises.

    <value>Strong passwords are the key to your digital life. Passwords are the digital keys to our networks of friends, our work colleagues, and even our banking and payment services. The most important two passwords are those for your email and social network accounts. It’s important to use entirely new and unique passwords for each account you might run, so you avoid compromising your data if one of your accounts gets hacked. To have a strong password it is extremely important not to include any personal information in your passwords. Hackers could attempt to log on to your account by guessing your password based off of personal information gained from your security questions. The shorter and less complex your password is, the quicker it can be to come up with the correct combination of characters and access your private information. A password cracker is a programme using a multitude of combinations in a very small amount of time until gaining full access to whatever your password was protecting. Use a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, symbols and numbers.</value>

    <value>Banks are facing many challenges and need to acquire encryption in so many different forms is ensuring that cards, pins and the transaction happening are secure. Various encryption algorithms are built into the communication network to prevent unauthorized transactions. Most financial institutions are using something called tokenization which will encrypt a portion of the data. The other type of encryption is when that data is in transit. Called back-end encryption, it ensures that the transit connection is encrypted until arriving to the database or server.</value>

    <value>In the world of finance, data security is a serious business. Encryption enables various types of economic activities that would otherwise not be possible. The financial services industry is one hit hardest by the heightened expectations of consumers to access information, receive help, and conduct transactions anywhere and at any time via their electronic devices. By converting plaintext into ciphertext, encryption helps banks, insurance companies, actors in the credit market, corporations, venture funds, investment advisors, fund managers, consulting firms etc. protect sensitive information so only the authorized users can, with the right key, decrypt and understand the information.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EIBM_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>It should come as no surprise that the financial industry is among the most regulated in the world. Electronic banking, a drastic change, has revolutionized the financial industry and therefore new regulations have been put in place to avoid possible fraudulent transactions.

  <data name="Blog_EILI_H2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>It is required that lawyers must observe the attorney-client privilege, that is, any information shared by the client to their lawyer should remain confidential and hence any testimony or information provided by the lawyer is inadmissible in court.Lawyers have access to trade secrets, intellectual property, and fictional skeletons of their clients ' closets. Also, as file sharing through email or the internet has made it easy to communicate with customers, they also carry significant risks, especially in regards to confidentiality. And this risk of protecting their clients' information must be taken seriously by the lawyers. Attorneys who fail to protect client data properly can lose clients, damage their reputation, or can also be charged with malpractice as a result of a data breach. Because attorney data contain all the information you want in regards to the client, with less cyber security on average, law firms have become a major target of the hacker community.</value>

    <value>In today’s era, data is a very important aspect and hence data security also has to be provided priority for all individuals and organizations, including IT firms, government firms, factories, businesses as well as in law firms. The legal profession is particularly vulnerable to lawyers' highly sensitive client information to be kept safe. Legal industries are very important as the responsibilities increase and hence encryption in the legal industry for credential data is too crucial. Lawyers need to be smart enough to protect clients sensitive information which is mostly not followed by law firms.</value>

  <data name="Blog_EITPS_Summary" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Companies are vulnerable to cyber attacks if they do not comprehend modern technology or recognise the need of data protection. It is widely assumed that privacy of data is only necessary when someone has something to hide but it is not the only motive.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EITPS_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;i&gt;According to security and privacy specialist Bruce Schneier, “Encryption works best if it is ubiquitous and automatic. It should be enabled for everything by default, not a feature you only turn on when you’re doing something you consider worth protecting.”&lt;/i&gt;</value>

  <data name="Blog_EITPS_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Companies are vulnerable to cyber attacks if they do not comprehend modern technology or recognise the need of data protection. It is widely assumed that privacy of data is only necessary when someone has something to hide but it is not the only motive. Securing data also assists in resolving the encroaching issues of privacy and protection that both customers and companies face, as well as deterring cybercriminals who seek to steal data from the internet as no company or individual is immune to security breaches.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EITPS_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Encryption converts information or data into a code that is difficult to decipher by third parties. When an encoded message is intercepted by an unauthorized entity, the inflator has to guess the variables that were used in the coding. The time and difficulty of guessing this information is what makes it a valuable security tool. This coding ensures that your private or corporate data is secured even if hackers get past a firewall. Recent studies show that encryption is increasing across all industries, with 48 percent of businesses adopting some form of encryption policy.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EITPS_Title" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Encryption isn’t the problem, it’s the solution</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EODAGDFWBES_H1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In simple terms, encryption transforms readable data into a scrambled and unreadable form called &lt;b&gt;ciphertext&lt;/b&gt;, so that it cannot be deciphered or made sense of by someone not allowed to access it. This way, encryption prevents unauthorized access or tampering with the data</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EODAGDFWBES_H1_Text10" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;6. 📤 Secure File Sharing:&lt;/b&gt; Encrypting files allows you to securely share them with others, ensuring that only authorized recipients can access and decrypt the files.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EODAGDFWBES_H1_Text11" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;7. 🔄 Data Loss Protection:&lt;/b&gt; In case of accidental file loss or system failures, encryption ensures that your data remains secure and inaccessible to anyone without the encryption key.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EODAGDFWBES_H1_Text12" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;8. ©️  Preserving Intellectual Property:&lt;/b&gt; If you have valuable intellectual property stored in the cloud, encrypting your files ensures that your proprietary information remains protected, reducing the risk of unauthorized use or theft.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EODAGDFWBES_H1_Text13" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;9. 🤝 Trust and Reputation:&lt;/b&gt; Encrypting files demonstrates your commitment to data security and privacy, enhancing trust and reputation among your clients, partners, and stakeholders.</value>

  <data name="Blog_EODAGDFWBES_H1_Text14" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;10. ✅ Future-Proofing:&lt;/b&gt; With the increasing emphasis on data security, encrypting your files now prepares you for future security requirements and ensures the long-term protection of your valuable information.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EODAGDFWBES_H1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>For example, if you encrypt “I like apples” with &lt;a href='https://axcrypt.net/download/.'&gt;&lt;b&gt;AxCrypt&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; software using the &lt;b&gt;AES 256-Bit&lt;/b&gt; algorithm, you get “v5u8/F28kOazjwQXTxY84+qeweiMvQ=.” This encrypted text appears completely unreadable, unless you decrypt it with the right key.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EODAGDFWBES_H1_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Decryption is the reverse process of encryption. It uses the same key to convert the encrypted text back into plain text. For example, decrypting “v5u8/F28kOazjwQXTxY84+qeweiMvQ=” you get “I like apples” again.</value>

    <value>Ever wondered how secure your sensitive personal files and your business data are on Google Drive and OneDrive cloud storage? Keeping files in the cloud is an excellent way to store, access and backup your data, but it might not always be the most private and secure way to do it.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EODAGDFWBES_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>According to &lt;a href='https://support.google.com/drive/answer/10375054?hl=en.'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Google&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it “processes” your stored data to enhance the user experience. This implies that Google maintains access to your files and has the ability to view them at its discretion. When it comes to your sensitive data, you cannot afford to take chances. You need to have full control over it.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EODAGDFWBES_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Encrypting your data and files at rest and before they reach the cloud is one of the safest measures to ensure that they remain secure at all times, even if a cloud storage provider has access to them or when the files get into the hands of a malicious attacker.</value>

    <value>The  &lt;a href='https://axcrypt.net/blog/symmetric-vs-asymmetric-encryption/'&gt;symmetric encryption algorithm&lt;/a&gt; known as Advanced Encryption Standard encodes data blocks of 128 bits at a time. The keys used to encrypt these data blocks have lengths of 128, 192, and 256 bits. A 256-bit key requires 14 rounds of data encryption, a 192-bit key requires 12 rounds, and a 128-bit key requires 10 rounds.Each cycle includes a number of stages for substitution, transposition, plaintext mixing, and other operations.</value>

    <value>Data is converted into ciphertext through encryption using a cipher (an encryption technique) and an encryption key. Once the ciphertext has been transmitted to the receiving party, a key (the same key for symmetric encryption; a different, related value for asymmetric encryption) is used to decode it back into the original value. Due to the similarity between encryption keys and physical keys, only users who possess the right key can “unlock” or decrypt the encrypted data.</value>

    <value>How does encryption software work?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ES_Heading2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Advantages of encryption software.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ES_Summary" xml:space="preserve">
    <value> Software for encryption changes plain-text files and text into text that cannot be read by known human languages.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ES_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Software for encryption changes plain-text files and text into text that cannot be read by known human languages. Software is used to transform legible text into an unintelligible format, which is known as encryption or cipher text. The file will need to be decrypted in order to be read once it has been encrypted</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ES_Title" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>What is encryption software?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EVA_H1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Access control is when a given identity is given permissions by a higher authority (is authorized) to perform actions such as reading a file.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EVA_H1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>For access control to work, we need authentication to ensure that the identity claim is actually authentic. Simply put – that I am who I claim to be. We also need someone to perform that authentication – typically an operating system or a server.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EVA_H1_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>When you limit access to a file using access control, such as when you store a file on a network server or in your cloud storage, it’s the responsibility of the operating system or cloud storage server to ask you for credentials (like a password) to prove who you are, and then to enforce the restrictions that you have set on your files. The authentication can be made stronger by for example 2 factor authentication.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EVA_H1_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>But it’s still a piece of software essentially asking you for proof of your claimed identity, and then based on that making decisions on what you can or can’t do with the files. Anyone with administrator access can always bypass these rules, since that’s what being an administrator means! Also, anyone with back-channel access to the data, such as a database backup, can access the data without being an administrator by using software that does not honor any access control to read the file.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EVA_H2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Encryption  does not care about who you are.  Decryption just either works or does not work, depending on if the right cryptographic key is provided to the decryption software.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EVA_H2_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>There is no software enforcing the security, the data is transformed with encryption into a form that reveals nothing about the real contents. To reverse the transformation, to decrypt it, the correct cryptographic key is required. If the wrong key is provided, the decryption software can only fail. There’s no bypassing by being an administrator or accessing the data via back-channels.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EVA_H2_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>This also means that contrary to access control, anyone who holds the correct key can decrypt the data. It does not matter who you are or claim to be. If you have the key, you can decrypt.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EVA_H2_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>That’s why the decryption key must be kept secret. That’s also why the encrypted content is irretrievably lost, if the decryption key is lost.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EVA_H2_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>AxCrypt is an encryption software. It encrypts files. It does not authenticate users in order to ‘allow’ contents to be viewed.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EVA_H3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If AxCrypt works by encryption, why does AxCrypt 2 ask you to sign in?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EVA_H3_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>We decided to use “sign in” as the metaphor for normal usage, because what happens is very similar, and most of us are used to “signing in”. What really happens is that we don’t authenticate the identity as such (your e-mail), but we do ensure that the password provided is correct and associated with the e-mail. There’s a subtle difference. AxCrypt uses the verified password to encrypt and decrypt. Access control systems uses the authenticated identity to match against permissions.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EVA_H3_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>This also means, that if two users actually have the same password, they will be able to decrypt each others files. That’s another reason to chose a really long, good and strong password so that this risk is reduced to effective zero.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EVA_H3_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>One of the reasons we verify the password at all for encryption is to reduce the risk of you mistyping the password when encrypting files, which unfortunately happens all too frequently with AxCrypt 1. Even with the requirement to type it twice.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EVA_H3_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>This AxCrypt sign in metahpor thus provides us with real benefits, we only have to enter it once per session and new files will be guaranteed to be encrypted with the password we actually intended to use – and which is verified to be the one we used the last time, i.e. the correct one.</value>

    <value>Effective data security is built on the foundation of key management also known as KMS. It is the process of administering or managing cryptographic keys. A critical feature of any KMS is its capacity to handle keys systematically throughout its lifecycle: key generation, key import/export, key distribution, key usage, key update, key backup, key revocation, and key deletion. Data is encrypted and decrypted using encryption keys, therefore the loss or compromise of any encryption key renders the data protection. It also ensures the safe transmission of data across an internet connection and not just includes access control but also monitoring and logging of each key's access, use, and context.</value>

  <data name="Blog_FOKM_H2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Key management deals with numerous types of security risks beyond encryption, such as people and incorrect policies, cyber attacks and data theft on networks. It is one of the most difficult components of cryptography. It also entails developing a system policy, user training, interdepartmental collaboration, and effective coordination.&lt;br/&gt;</value>

    <value>&lt;a href='https://axcrypt.net/download'&gt;&lt;b&gt;File encryption&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a process where contents of a file are transformed into an unreadable and undecipherable format. The process involves using an encryption algorithm, such as AES, along with encryption keys. The encryption keys contain the precise pattern for the algorithm to transform the file’s contents, so that the same keys can be used to reverse the encryption process (decryption) to restore the file’s contents to its original state.</value>

    <value>Exploitation of an individual’s interest by a scammer in order to access restricted information. Phishing is by far the most entrenched form of data security breach in this sphere. Due to its nature, the victims of this form of data breach at times have no idea that they are leaving themselves open to exploitation. The way phishing works is that the entity with the intention to access unauthorized information lures the potential victim into thinking that they are engaging with a legitimate online entity; usually via email to access the desired information. The victim, unaware that they are being scammed, end up giving the desired information themselves. To the mind of the victim, they are only giving out desired information to a legitimate online platform. The end result is that the person ends up aiding in the data breach, albeit unknowingly, through accessing malicious links or email attachments.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HEIDS_H10_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Outsourcing or dealing with contractors whose perspective of data security might be different from that of the organization that is contacting outside vendors. Outsourcing has been known to contribute to cases of data breaches. When vendors have access to information that is deemed sensitive and they themselves do not appreciate its importance, which could lead to serious data leakages.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HEIDS_H2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Mail misdelivery is another form of human error that impacts on data security. Misdelivery occurs when those entrusted with the delivery of sensitive information either intentionally or unknowingly end up delivering such information to unauthorized users. In this age of email mass marketing and other forms of massive data transfer, persons handling such transfers are mandated to guarantee the safety of data being sent. The use of encryption in such transfers helps minimize the accessibility of such information should it find its way to unintended recipients.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HEIDS_H3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Unauthorized access to information outlets such as company devices. Those entrusted with such devices should treat them with the importance they deserve. It’s not uncommon to find employees with access to such devices allowing unrestricted access to their friends or family members. It’s during those interactions that information can be accessed without the person’s knowledge, leading to a serious breach in data security. The owners of such devices should be trained on the importance of the gadgets in their possession as they are literally the gatekeepers of such sensitive information.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HEIDS_H4_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Poor password usage can seriously undermine a person’s or corporate data. The accessibility to such information should be password protected. In fact, it’s no longer just about having a password. More is expected, the routine changing of these passwords guarantees that access to such information is restricted. Another way would be to avoid using obvious words for passwords. Individuals entrusted with password requesting devices should avoid sharing such passwords. Corporations should emphasise to their employees the importance of employing proper password management practices to avoid data security breaches.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HEIDS_H5_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Inadequate or in some cases absence of relevant training on people entrusted with such data. The frequent incorporation of information management systems to members of staff that handle sensitive information minimizes the risk of human error, as members can refer to their training on best practices employed in the handling of such information. The absence of such laid out guidelines and expectations would most definitely expose employees to violations in data security.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HEIDS_H6_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Little awareness of matters relating to data security. Security has to be emphasized to all members handling company data. Issues on software upgrade that bring about improved security measures are not a management issue alone. Best internet and data handling software should be put to use and the relevant persons educated on their importance and use. Things like data security upgrades should be at the forefront of staff members in conjunction with the relevant Information technology personnel. Data security should be a primary responsibility of all staff members; it’s the absence of such awareness that could lead to data being compromised.</value>

  <data name="Blog_HEIDS_H7_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Careless or outright incompetence when it comes to data handling. In the daily execution of one’s duties, set out procedures might be overlooked. The need to meet targets and deadlines will most often make people overlook procedures that they consider cumbersome. These shortcuts are sometimes the root course of known data breaches. It’s the responsibility of those charged with management to ensure laid out data handling procedures adhere to irrespective of the workload. In the rush to finish assignments employees who are not keen to details might be responsible for coursing data breaches.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HEIDS_H8_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Unrestricted data usage is yet another factor that results in data being compromised. The ease with which persons access any or all information should be a subject of scrutiny. By leaving an institution’s data access points manned and the need to apply multiple layers, authentication when accessing or requesting certain data that is considered sensitive is critical in limiting data leakages. The absence of such measures means that anybody with access can retrieve any information they so wish for their personal use. Restriction brings about accountability and traceability, especially when dealing with sensitive information.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HEIDS_H9_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The human aspect associated with budget allocation in matters relating to data security is sometimes to blame for data breaches. With management always on the lookout for cost-cutting measures, the need to invest and come up with a sustained approach to a data breach scenario might not be appreciated. This is especially so when the said company has never experienced any data breaches. The failure to allocate funds and invest in data security measures leaves the company vulnerable to data attacks, more so when they are ill prepared when these attacks occur.</value>

  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HFMICTETP_H1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>It’s common sense that stronger encryption leads to more protected information. Most of the time, 128-bit encryption is already enough to secure your files. It keeps away brute force attacks and renders most hackers ineffective when trying to access your information.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HFMICTETP_H1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>However, some providers offer 256-bit encryption for file encryption, which is the most premium protection available. 256-bit encryption is being utilized to protect confidential and top secret data across the world, and as technology continuously evolves, most sectors would need to consider shifting to stronger encryption methods.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HFMICTETP_H1_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Enterprises need to at least acquire an enterprise encryption software with 128-bit encryption so that their documents will not be vulnerable to cyberattacks, but as these threats become more complex and as hackers continue to look for loopholes to breach data, establishments can afford to gain extra peace of mind and security with 256-bit encryption.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HFMICTETP_H3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Smartphones and other mobile devices have been gaining ground during the most recent years. &lt;a href='https://www.bankmycell.com/blog/how-many-phones-are-in-the-world'&gt;Latest data&lt;/a&gt; tallies 3.5 billion smartphone users and 4.8 billion smart and feature phone users across the globe, and while offices remain a preferable environment for employees, some staff members are more comfortable with working on tablets or mobile phones as they live on the go. As such, businesses have gone beyond only using the computer for file management.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HFMICTETP_H3_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>However, a lot of them still struggle in searching for a solution for safekeeping the data stored and gone across these devices. Threats continue to lurk despite the convenience and with that, potential risks and losses for any organization.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HFMICTETP_H3_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Luckily, enterprise encryption software is now readily available in the market, providing organizations guaranteed safety with all their files across any device.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HFMICTETP_H3_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The system supplies businesses with features of encryption that can be found in documents housed on a desktop, turning an unwarranted and stressful scenario into a manageable situation and giving you peace of mind during your entire file management process.</value>

  <data name="Blog_HFMICTETP_H4_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>When discussing file encryption, most companies are led to believe that protection needs to be at its best during distribution and delivery. However, these are just two points in the entire file journey, and any company that wishes to keep up with the times must look at the bigger picture and consider all the stops when it comes to file management. That’s &lt;a href='https://axcrypt.net/blog/what-encryption-really-is-about/'&gt;what encryption really is about&lt;/a&gt;.</value>

  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HFMICTETP_H5_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Since cloud computing revolutionized document management, an increasing number of organizations search for enterprise encryption software that offers cloud encryption solutions to encode information in transit.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HFMICTETP_H5_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>As data moves from cloud-based platforms and storage to users with access to that information, a strong encryption code is deployed to protect the files from external users that can intercept information as they travel to and from the cloud or when documents are being saved to your cloud’s storage.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HFMICTETP_H5_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>As an added convenience to their robust features of encryption, some providers oversee encryption for their clients. They’re also open to empowering customers with the option to manage their own encryption keys. If you’re looking for a solution that is focused on cloud encryption, it would be good to check out this list of &lt;a href='https://collaboration-software.financesonline.com/c/file-sharing-document-management/'&gt;file sharing and document management software that offers security&lt;/a&gt;.</value>

    <value>&lt;b&gt;ZV:&lt;/b&gt; File encryption! Our vision: security, reliability, and simplicity. Everything we make is done with these as the highest priority. Our file encryption software is available for free, and we add another layer of features in AxCrypt Premium and Business. This includes a password manager and key sharing.</value>

  <data name="Blog_HOA_H2_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;ZV:&lt;/b&gt; We have many private individuals that use AxCrypt. As for businesses, we see mainly financial services, governmental institutions (administration, education, health care), and IT companies.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HOA_H3_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;ZV:&lt;/b&gt; Ransomware has seen a huge increase over the last few years, probably in part due to companies getting better at securing their data. The problem is that in ransomware attacks, keeping your data encrypted is not enough. It’s more important than ever to make sure you have recent backups of all of your important data, and that these backups are stored in separate locations, so an attacker can never get to both your live data and backups.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HOA_H4_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;ZV:&lt;/b&gt; More and more of our society is connected, but it will be even more so in the future. The Internet of Things (IoT) has been a topic for the last decade, but it has yet to really make an impact. When this impact comes, it means every household will have numerous connected devices, some of which you might not even realize is connected and hence very poorly protected. More poorly protected devices mean more attack vectors which can be used for a whole multitude of malicious intents.</value>

    <value>Phone encryption is not a new concept in the mobile business, and it has become an unavoidable element of the design process for all smartphone makers. Mobile encryption can accomplish everything for you, from preventing your data from being stolen to keeping your personal information safe. Now that you understand the need for encrypted data, encrypt all of your mobile devices to protect your data from unauthorized access.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HPDYMP_H1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Mobile phones have become an integral part of our daily lives. They have become the main target for hackers as a result of the global pandemic and the rise in remote work. There are many undiscovered risks out there attempting to get private data on your mobile device. When it comes to the information stored on a phone, many people underestimate its true worth. Your phone contains all of your personal information while acting as a data bank and a social media hub.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HPDYMP_H1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Mobile security is a precautionary measure used to safeguard data against a variety of threats aimed to invade privacy and steal any other information kept on the phone. These data assaults are aimed towards stealing personal information, such as bank account numbers, login credentials, and other information. Make no mistake about a hacker's abilities. Hackers have a simple way of manipulating or stealing your phone's data. Hacking isn't necessarily limited to collecting usernames and passwords or sending out phishing emails.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HPDYMP_H2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Identity theft, fraud, and the theft of financial resources from employees and consumers are all possible outcomes of unprotected data. Every year, 4.3% of company-issued smartphones are lost or stolen. On average, roughly 10,573 mobile breaches occur per day. Large, small, public, and private enterprises all experience data breaches. In fact, hackers are increasingly targeting small and mid-sized organizations since their networks are less secure.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HPDYMP_H2_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Hackers now have the ability to listen in on chats and hack into any data on your phone. Without your permission, your social media accounts, bank accounts, sensitive images, private text messages, and more could be accessed.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HPDYMP_H3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Perhaps the simplest approach to keep your phone safe from unauthorized is using a passcode. But that isn't enough; cracking someone's passcode is no longer rocket science. Mobile data encryption is one of the best ways to protect your sensitive information on a phone, even while you are on the go. AxCrypt Mobile encryption is beyond a regular lock screen password.

    <value>Before we dive deeper into details of password authentication and password cracking methods, let’s first look at some stats and understand how they impact the way you generate, use, and save new passwords.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HQHCYP_H1_Text10" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>9.Over &lt;b&gt;80%&lt;/b&gt; of users admit to reusing passwords across multiple accounts.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HQHCYP_H1_Text11" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>10.In 2022, there were over &lt;b&gt;2.29 billion&lt;/b&gt; global records exposed in data breaches.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HQHCYP_H1_Text12" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>11.&lt;b&gt;Phishing&lt;/b&gt; is the most common tactic used by hackers to obtain passwords.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HQHCYP_H1_Text13" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>12.&lt;b&gt;Brute force&lt;/b&gt; attacks are responsible for approximately &lt;b&gt;5%&lt;/b&gt; of successful data breaches. Brute force attack is a trial-and-error method used by hackers to guess a password by systematically checking all possible combinations of characters until the correct one is found. The checking is done using automated tools or a coding script written by hackers.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HQHCYP_H1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>1.In 2022,&lt;b&gt;“123456”&lt;/b&gt; was the most commonly used password, followed by &lt;b&gt;“123456789”&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;“password”&lt;/b&gt;.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HQHCYP_H1_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>2.A recent survey showed that only &lt;b&gt;53%&lt;/b&gt; of people use different passwords for different accounts, leaving the rest vulnerable to potential hacks.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HQHCYP_H1_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>3.The average user has &lt;b&gt;26&lt;/b&gt; password protected accounts.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HQHCYP_H1_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>4.Approximately &lt;b&gt;10%&lt;/b&gt; of internet users have used &lt;b&gt;“123456”&lt;/b&gt; as their password.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HQHCYP_H1_Text6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>5.A &lt;b&gt;six-character&lt;/b&gt; password containing only lowercase letters can be cracked in less than &lt;b&gt;10 minutes&lt;/b&gt;.</value>

    <value>6.A &lt;b&gt;12-character&lt;/b&gt; password containing uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols can take over &lt;b&gt;1,000&lt;/b&gt; years to crack.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HQHCYP_H1_Text8" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>7.The most common password length is &lt;b&gt;8 characters&lt;/b&gt;.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HQHCYP_H1_Text9" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>8.Approximately &lt;b&gt;81%&lt;/b&gt; of data breaches are due to weak or stolen passwords.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HQHCYP_H2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>When you log in to a website or application, the password authentication process begins. You enter your username or email address and password, and the website or app checks this information against a database of user credentials.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HQHCYP_H2_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The password you enter is usually encrypted using a mathematical algorithm, such as &lt;b&gt;SHA-256&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;AES-256&lt;/b&gt;, which scrambles your password into a unique string of characters that cannot be easily reversed or deciphered. This encrypted version of your password is stored in the website or app's database, along with your username or email address.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HQHCYP_H2_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>During the account creation process, the password is first hashed (converted) using a one-way function that transforms the password into a unique string of characters. The resulting hash is then stored in the system's database. The next time the user tries to log in, the password they provide is hashed again and compared to the stored hash. If the two hashes match, the user is authenticated and granted access to the system.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HQHCYP_H2_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>To ensure the security of the password, it is essential to hash the password before storing it in the system's database. Hashing ensures that the password is not saved in plain text, making it difficult for attackers to read and use the password if they gain access to the system's database.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HQHCYP_H2_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Moreover, many systems incorporate additional security measures like salting, which adds a random string of characters to the password before hashing. Salting ensures that attackers cannot use precomputed hashes of commonly used passwords to easily crack the password, adding another layer of security.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HQHCYP_H2_Text6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>When you try to log in again, the website or app will re-encrypt the password you enter and compare it to the encrypted version stored in the database. If the two versions match, you are granted access to the site or app. This process ensures that only authorized users with the correct password can access their accounts.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HQHCYP_H2_Text7" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Password authentication is not always fool proof. Passwords can be stolen or guessed by attackers using various methods, such as brute-force attacks or social engineering. As a result, it is essential to follow password best practices, such as using a long and complex password, using unique passwords for each account, and changing passwords frequently.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HQHCYP_H3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Hackers use various methods and algorithms to crack passwords, including brute force attacks and social engineering techniques like phishing. Let’s explore some of the most commonly used techniques for password cracking.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HQHCYP_H3_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;strong&gt;Brute Force Attack:&lt;/strong&gt; The most basic algorithm of cracking a password is known as a brute force attack. This method involves using a program to guess every possible combination of characters until the correct password is found. While this may seem like a time-consuming and tedious process, modern computers are incredibly fast and can guess millions of password combinations per second.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HQHCYP_H3_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;strong&gt;Dictionary Attack:&lt;/strong&gt; Another method used to crack passwords is the dictionary attack. In this method, the attacker uses a program that has a pre-existing list of commonly used passwords and tries them one by one until the correct password is found. This list of passwords is known as a password dictionary and can be created by the attacker or downloaded from the internet.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HQHCYP_H3_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;strong&gt;Phishing:&lt;/strong&gt; Phishing is a social engineering attack that involves tricking a user into revealing their password. Attackers create fake login pages that look identical to the real ones and send the user a link to the fake page. When the user enters their password, the attacker captures it and can use it to gain access to the user's account.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HQHCYP_H3_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;strong&gt;Keystroke Logging:&lt;/strong&gt; Keystroke logging involves installing a program on a victim's computer that records every keystroke made by the user, including their password. Attackers can then retrieve the recorded keystrokes and use them to gain access to the victim's account.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HQHCYP_H3_Text6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;strong&gt;Shoulder Surfing:&lt;/strong&gt; Shoulder surfing involves physically watching a user enter their password. Attackers can do this by standing close to the victim or using a hidden camera to record the user's keystrokes. Once the password is captured, the attacker can use it to gain access to the user's account.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HQHCYP_H3_Text7" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Each technique has its own strengths and weaknesses, and hackers very cleverly utilize each of it to prepare and execute the attack. As a result, it is crucial to have a comprehensive approach to password protection to ensure that your credentials are secure from hacking attempt</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HQHCYP_H4_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>To ensure the security of your passwords and protect them from malicious attacks by hackers, there are several methods, tips, and best practices that can be employed. By implementing the appropriate methods and techniques, you can ensure that your passwords remain safe and secure at all times. Some of the best methods you can use are:</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HQHCYP_H4_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;strong&gt;Complex Passwords:&lt;/strong&gt; One of the simplest ways to protect your passwords is to use strong and complex passwords. Passwords should be at least eight characters long and should include a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. A strong password makes it more difficult for hackers to crack your password using brute-force attacks.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HQHCYP_H4_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>For example, a password like &lt;b&gt;“X@xg0n$&amp;p1E”&lt;/b&gt; would take billions of years to be cracked using brute force even with the fastest computers available today. You can use a password generator like &lt;a href='https://account.axcrypt.net/en/Home/Login?Signup=True'&gt;AxCrypt’s Password Manager&lt;/a&gt;  to automatically generate and save complex passwords.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HQHCYP_H4_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;strong&gt;Password Managers:&lt;/strong&gt; A password manager is a tool that generates and stores complex passwords for all your online accounts. It stores your passwords in an encrypted database, and you only need to remember one master password to access all your passwords. This method of password protection helps to ensure that you don't use the same password for multiple accounts, which reduces the risk of a password breach.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HQHCYP_H4_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;strong&gt;Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):&lt;/strong&gt; Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your account. It requires you to enter a verification code in addition to your password to log into your account. The verification code can be sent to your phone via text message, email, or an authenticator app. This method of authentication helps to ensure that only the authorized user has access to the account.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HQHCYP_H4_Text6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;strong&gt;Biometric Authentication:&lt;/strong&gt; Biometric authentication uses unique biological characteristics such as fingerprints, facial recognition, or iris scans to identify users. This method of authentication is more secure than passwords since it's difficult for hackers to fake biometric data. Biometric authentication is increasingly being used in mobile devices and laptops to improve security.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HQHCYP_H4_Text7" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;strong&gt;Password-less Authentication:&lt;/strong&gt; Password-less authentication is a new trend in password protection. It replaces the traditional password with other forms of authentication such as biometrics, security tokens, or one-time passwords.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HQHCYP_H4_Text8" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>This method of authentication is more secure since it eliminates the risk of password theft and password reuse.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HQHCYP_H4_Text9" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Apart from these methods, one more highly effective password protection practice is to change your password frequently. This is because the longer you use a password, the higher the chances are that it may get compromised. Regularly changing your password ensures that even if a hacker gains access to it, they won't be able to use it for long before it becomes invalid.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HQHCYP_H5_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>A password manager is a software application that helps users generate, store, and manage passwords securely. It’s a tool that can be used to create unique, complex passwords for each of your online accounts and store them in a secure vault. The benefits of using a password manager are numerous, but the primary advantage is that it makes it easier to create and remember strong passwords.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HQHCYP_H5_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Using a password manager can also improve the overall security of your online accounts. Since many people tend to use the same password across multiple accounts, if one password is compromised, it can lead to a domino effect of security breaches across all your other accounts. With a password manager, you can ensure that each account has a unique and complex password, which greatly reduces the risk of a data breach.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HQHCYP_H5_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Another advantage of using a password manager is that it can save you a lot of time. Remembering multiple passwords can be difficult, and having to reset them frequently can be frustrating. With a password manager, you only need to remember one master password to access all of your other passwords. This not only saves you time, but it also reduces the chances of forgetting your password and being locked out of your account.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HQHCYP_H5_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Opting for a password manager is a wise decision that can provide you with peace of mind. With its simple yet effective approach, you can secure your online accounts and steer clear of the stress and financial loss that often accompany data breaches. By taking proactive measures to safeguard your personal information, you can rest assured that your online accounts are well protected, and your sensitive data is safe from prying eyes.</value>

  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HREAYSD_H1_SH1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Encryption methods essentially can be divided into two categories: &lt;a href='https://axcrypt.net/blog/symmetric-vs-asymmetric-encryption/'&gt;&lt;b&gt;symmetric and asymmetric&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Symmetric encryption uses the same secret key for both encryption and decryption of the data. The same key is shared between the sender and receiver of the encrypted data.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HREAYSD_H1_SH1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Asymmetric encryption, on the other hand, involves two keys: a public key and a private key. The public key is used to encrypt the data, while the private key is used to decrypt it. This approach ensures that only the intended recipient, who has the private key, can decrypt the data.  </value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HREAYSD_H1_SH1_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Although asymmetric encryption is often deemed more secure than symmetric encryption, it can be slower and more resource-intensive.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HREAYSD_H1_SH1_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Different encryption algorithms have been devised based on the symmetric and asymmetric methods, and in this blog, we will discuss the three most popular ones: &lt;strong&gt;AES, 3DES, and RSA.&lt;/strong&gt; </value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HREAYSD_H1_SubHeading1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;strong&gt;Types of Encryption Methods:&lt;/strong&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HREAYSD_H1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Encryption is a process of converting the plain text into an illegible text known as ciphertext. A computing device does this by running the text through one of the encryption algorithms, such as AES, to randomly rearrange and scramble the given text – making it impossible to read during the transmission. </value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HREAYSD_H1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The rearrangement of text is backed by very intricate mathematical calculations known as a &lt;strong&gt;‘key’&lt;/strong&gt;, and the same mathematical calculations used for encryption are reversed to decrypt the text, allowing only the authorized individuals to access the original plain text. </value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HREAYSD_H2_SH1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The AES encryption algorithm, also known as Rijndael, is a popular symmetric encryption algorithm used to protect data. AES algorithm has key lengths of 128, 192, or 256 bits, which means it can convert a 128, 192, or 256 bits of text blocks at once.  </value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HREAYSD_H2_SH1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>AES operates on the Substitution–Permutation Network &lt;strong&gt;(SPN)&lt;/strong&gt;, using a combination of substitution and permutation rounds to cipher the text. Which means, the plaintext data is first broken into blocks or chunks, then substituted &lt;strong&gt;(replaced)&lt;/strong&gt; and permutated &lt;strong&gt;(scrambled)&lt;/strong&gt; over the course of several rounds using complex calculation, making the resulted ciphertext practically impossible to decipher. </value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HREAYSD_H2_SH1_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The encryption process involves several sub-processes, including sub bytes, shift rows, mix columns, and add round keys. During the process, the text is scrabbled in multiple rounds. The number of rounds performed depends on the size of the key, which for AES is 10, 12, or 14 rounds.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HREAYSD_H2_SH2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The 3DES encryption algorithm is an upgrade to the DES or Data Encryption Standard algorithm, that applies the DES algorithm thrice to each data block. This process made 3DES much harder to crack than its predecessor, and it became widely used in payment systems, standards, and technology in the finance industry. </value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HREAYSD_H2_SH2_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>However, the &lt;strong&gt;Sweet32&lt;/strong&gt; vulnerability exposed the security holes within 3DES. In response, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) announced the deprecation of 3DES in a draft guidance published in 2019. The use of 3DES is set to be scrapped and discontinued in all new applications after 2023.</value>

    <value>RSA is an asymmetric encryption algorithm developed by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman in 1977. It is widely used in many applications, including SSL/TLS certificates, crypto-currencies, and email encryption. </value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HREAYSD_H2_SH3_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>RSA's potency lies in the “prime factorization” method that it relies upon, where two huge random prime numbers are multiplied to create another giant number. The puzzle is to determine the original prime numbers from this giant-sized multiplied number. The difficulty of brute-forcing the key increases with each expanding key length, and RSA offers various encryption key lengths such as 768-bit, 1024-bit, 2048-bit, 4096-bit, etc</value>

  <data name="Blog_HSBCPTFGCT_H1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>It may seem like large corporations with vast amounts of data would be the main targets of cybercriminals, but small businesses are often seen as low-hanging fruit. Why? Here are a few reasons:</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HSBCPTFGCT_H1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>1. &lt;b&gt;Limited Resources:&lt;/b&gt; SMBs typically don’t have the same budget or dedicated cybersecurity teams as larger corporations, making it harder for them to invest in comprehensive security measures.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HSBCPTFGCT_H1_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>2. &lt;b&gt;Lack of Cyber Expertise:&lt;/b&gt; Many small businesses don’t have in-house experts who can identify, investigate, or respond to cyber threats effectively.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HSBCPTFGCT_H1_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>3. &lt;b&gt;Valuable Data:&lt;/b&gt; Despite their size, SMBs store sensitive information—like customer data, intellectual property, and financial records—which is valuable to hackers.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HSBCPTFGCT_H1_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>4. &lt;b&gt;Supply Chain Vulnerabilities:&lt;/b&gt; Small businesses are often part of larger supply chains. A breach in one SMB can compromise an entire network, making them an appealing entry point for cybercriminals.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HSBCPTFGCT_H2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Cybercriminals use a variety of tactics to breach small businesses. Here are a few of the most common methods:</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HSBCPTFGCT_H2_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Phishing Attacks:&lt;/b&gt; These involve emails that look legitimate but are designed to trick employees into clicking on malicious links or providing sensitive information.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HSBCPTFGCT_H2_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trojans:&lt;/b&gt; Malware that disguises itself as a legitimate program, giving hackers access to your systems and data once it’s downloaded.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HSBCPTFGCT_H2_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ransomware:&lt;/b&gt; Hackers use ransomware to lock down your data and demand payment in exchange for its release.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HSBCPTFGCT_H2_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Credential Theft:&lt;/b&gt; Cybercriminals steal usernames and passwords to gain access to accounts, often through weak password policies or data leaks.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HSBCPTFGCT_H2_Text6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wi-Fi Vulnerabilities:&lt;/b&gt; If employees connect to insecure public Wi-Fi, hackers can easily intercept their data and gain access to business networks.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HSBCPTFGCT_H2_Text7" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>With attacks happening so frequently, the question isn’t if your business will be targeted, but when.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HSBCPTFGCT_H3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>While having cybersecurity insurance can provide some peace of mind, it’s not a catch-all solution. Cyber insurance can help cover the costs associated with a breach, such as legal fees, fines, and recovery expenses, but it won’t prevent an attack from happening in the first place. In fact, if your business doesn’t have adequate security measures in place, you may face higher premiums or even be denied coverage.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HSBCPTFGCT_H3_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>This is why it’s essential to pair insurance with proactive cybersecurity practices. Prevention is always better than trying to recover from a devastating attack.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HSBCPTFGCT_H4_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Employees are often the first line of defense in preventing cyberattacks. They should be educated about safe online practices, but it’s a team effort. Here’s how employees and businesses can work together:</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HSBCPTFGCT_H4_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Employee Education:&lt;/b&gt; Regular training on identifying phishing attempts, creating strong passwords, and using secure communication channels is crucial. Encourage employees to report suspicious activity without fear of repercussions.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HSBCPTFGCT_H4_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Simulated Phishing Tests:&lt;/b&gt; Test your employees by sending fake phishing emails to see how they respond. This can help identify gaps in awareness and provide an opportunity for additional training.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HSBCPTFGCT_H4_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Secure Devices:&lt;/b&gt; Make sure employees use company-approved devices for work, and implement strong security policies like multi-factor authentication and VPNs for remote access.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HSBCPTFGCT_H4_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cybersecurity Newsletters:&lt;/b&gt; Regular updates through emails or internal newsletters keep cybersecurity top of mind for employees, helping to reinforce good practices.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HSBCPTFGCT_H5_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>From a business owner or IT manager's perspective, having a robust cybersecurity plan is key. Here are a few steps you can take to ensure your business is protected:</value>
  </data>

    <value>Encryption methods generally fall into two categories: &lt;b&gt;symmetric&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;asymmetric encryption&lt;/b&gt;. Each serves different purposes, and understanding their distinctions is key to choosing the right solution.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HTCTREFYSD_H3_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Symmetric encryption&lt;/b&gt; uses a single key for both encryption and decryption. While fast and efficient, the challenge lies in securely sharing the key between parties.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HTCTREFYSD_H3_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Asymmetric encryption&lt;/b&gt; involves two keys: a public key to encrypt the data and a private key to decrypt it. This adds an extra layer of security, as only the intended recipient can decrypt the information. Although more secure, this method is slower and more resource-intensive.&lt;/li&gt;</value>

    <value>The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 &lt;b&gt;(HIPAA)&lt;/b&gt; is a United State’s federal law that mandates creation of rules to prevent unauthorized disclosure of sensitive healthcare data – without a patient's consent.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HTCWHER_H1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Enacted in 1996, HIPAA is regulated by the US Department of Health and Human Services &lt;b&gt;(HHS)&lt;/b&gt; and enforced by the Office for Civil Rights &lt;b&gt;(OCR)&lt;/b&gt;. HIPAA’s protection covers protected health information &lt;b&gt;(PHI)&lt;/b&gt;, which includes any data that can be used to identify an individual within the course of a healthcare journey.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HTCWHER_H1_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;PHI&lt;/b&gt; encompasses a wide range of data, including medical records, patient histories, laboratory test results, and billing information. Additionally, HIPAA safeguards other identifying information such as names, addresses, social security numbers, and even IP addresses if they are associated with health information.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HTCWHER_H2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Encryption, particularly in file security, transforms data into an unreadable format using complex algorithms and cryptographic keys. The original data, called plaintext, becomes ciphertext after encryption, and decryption reverses this process.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HTCWHER_H2_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>During encryption, the algorithm rearranges and alters the data, guided by cryptographic keys, to create a scrambled version that can be restored to its original state through decryption.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HTCWHER_H2_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>This method differs from simple password protection, which only secures data with a password, leaving it vulnerable to unauthorized access. Encryption, however, renders data indecipherable without the decryption key, providing robust protection even if data is leaked or accessed without authorization.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HTCWHER_H2_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In healthcare, where safeguarding sensitive patient information is crucial under HIPAA regulations, encryption serves as a vital tool to ensure data security. It acts like a secret code, scrambling data to prevent unauthorized access, unlike password protection, which can be easily bypassed with the right tools.</value>

    <value>Encryption is a process of scrambling data so that it cannot be read by unauthorized users. File encryption works by transforming the contents within a file into an indecipherable and unreadable format. This transformation involves an encryption algorithm and cryptographic keys to rearrange the contents of a file.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HTEDOYAAIPI2_H1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The algorithm has steps that perform permutation or rearrangement of file’s content, such as substituting, shifting, replacing, and mixing to scrabble the data. The cryptographic keys are used to determine the order or specific operations to be performed so that the entire encryption process can be repeated or reversed to decrypt a file.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HTEDOYAAIPI2_H1_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Similar to a real-life padlock and key combination, only the specific cryptographic keys used during the encryption process can decrypt a file. Let’s better understand file encryption with a simple example: Suppose you have a file on your phone containing important and sensitive data, such as tax statements or financial records. Once encrypted, the file's contents will be transformed and scrambled, appearing something like this: &lt;strong&gt;‘U2FsdGVkX1+Ww/kwN8Bn’&lt;/strong&gt; – a completely undecipherable string of characters that can only be decoded with the right key.</value>

In specific terms, the original file or data that needs to be encrypted is called &lt;b&gt;plaintext&lt;/b&gt;, and the transformed content after the encryption process is called &lt;b&gt;ciphertext&lt;/b&gt;. The reverse of the encryption process to retrieve the original plaintext from the encrypted ciphertext is called &lt;b&gt;decryption&lt;/b&gt;.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HTEFOWAWA_H1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>During the file encryption process, the algorithm reorganizes, shifts, mixes, and alters the contents of the files into a random arrangement of characters. The cryptographic keys dictate the precise sequence or procedures of these alterations, allowing for the reversal of the encryption process to restore the contents of the files to their original state.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HTEFOWAWA_H2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Encryption is intrinsically different from simply password protecting a file, as encryption completely transforms the contents of a file after it is encrypted. When compared to password protection or any other method, a file might only be shielded by a password, whereas encryption ensures that the file's contents are scrambled and unreadable without the decryption key.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HTEFOWAWA_H2_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>This makes encryption a far more robust and secure method of protecting sensitive information, as it renders the data indecipherable to unauthorized parties even if they gain access to the file.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HTEFOWAWA_H2_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Think of encryption like a secret code that jumbles up the contents of a file, making it impossible to understand without the correct key to decipher it. On the other hand, password protection simply puts a lock on the file that can be easily bypassed or cracked with the right tools or techniques.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HTEFOWAWA_H3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Different encryption tools with different methods are available for Windows. Essentially, you can encrypt your files and data in two main ways: &lt;a href='https://axcrypt.net/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-file-encryption-vs-disk-encryption-which-one-is-best-for-you/'&gt;&lt;b&gt;file encryption and disk encryption&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. File encryption, as the name suggests, encrypts individual files or folders, providing granular control over security measures. On the other hand, disk encryption encrypts the entire disk, including the operating system and related files.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HTEFOWAWA_H3_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In terms of disk encryption, &lt;a href='https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/operating-system-security/data-protection/bitlocker/'&gt;&lt;b&gt;BitLocker&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a built-in option on Windows. While powerful, it is limited to &lt;b&gt;Windows Pro&lt;/b&gt; users and lacks the simplicity and accessibility desired by many users. This complexity can be frustrating and time-consuming for users looking for straightforward solutions to protect their sensitive files and not an entire disk.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HTEFOWAWA_H3_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>On the other hand, &lt;a href='https://axcrypt.net/'&gt;&lt;b&gt;AxCrypt&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a superior option for automatic file encryption on Windows. Unlike BitLocker and device encryption, AxCrypt prioritizes simplicity and effectiveness, offering a seamless and intuitive experience for users.

    <value>&lt;b&gt;Malware Embedding:&lt;/b&gt; Cybercriminals often exploit PDF files by embedding malware within them. These malicious files can be disguised as legitimate documents and distributed via email or file-sharing platforms. Once opened, the malware can infect the user's device, leading to data breaches or system compromise.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HTSPWESBSI2_H1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;Phishing Attacks:&lt;/b&gt; PDF files are commonly used in phishing attacks, where attackers trick users into clicking on malicious links or downloading infected attachments. These phishing PDFs may appear to be legitimate documents from trusted sources, making them difficult to identify as threats.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HTSPWESBSI2_H1_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;Exploitable Security Flaws:&lt;/b&gt; PDF reader software and the PDF format itself may contain security vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. These flaws could allow attackers to bypass security controls, execute arbitrary code, or gain unauthorized access to sensitive information stored within PDF files.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HTSPWESBSI2_H1_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;Password Weaknesses:&lt;/b&gt; Password-protected PDF files are only as secure as the strength of their passwords. Weak or easily guessable passwords can be cracked using brute-force attacks, allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access to the contents of the PDF.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HTSPWESBSI2_H1_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;Metadata Leakage:&lt;/b&gt; PDF files can contain hidden metadata that may inadvertently disclose sensitive information about the document or its author. This metadata could include details such as author names, creation dates, or revision history, which could be exploited by attackers for social engineering or targeted attacks.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HTSPWESBSI2_H2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;Encryption:&lt;/b&gt; One of the most effective ways to secure PDF files is by encrypting them with a password. Encryption scrambles the content of the PDF, making it unreadable without the correct password. This prevents unauthorized users from accessing the document's contents, even if they gain access to the file.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HTSPWESBSI2_H2_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;Access Controls:&lt;/b&gt; PDF files can be protected with access controls that restrict who can view, edit, or print the document. Access control settings can specify user permissions, such as allowing only certain users to view the document while preventing others from viewing or opening it</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HTSPWESBSI2_H2_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;Redaction:&lt;/b&gt; Redaction is the process of permanently removing sensitive or confidential information from a PDF document. This can include text, images, or other content that should not be disclosed to unauthorized parties. Redaction tools allow users to selectively remove or obscure sensitive information before sharing the document. While it can remove sensitive information, it's not a good choice when you actually want to share sensitive information</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HTSPWESBSI2_H2_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;Secure File Transfer:&lt;/b&gt; When sharing PDF files, it's essential to use secure file transfer methods to prevent interception or unauthorized access during transmission. Secure file transfer protocols, such as SFTP or HTTPS, encrypting data at rest before sharing it, ensuring that it remains secure from prying eyes.</value>

    <value>&lt;b&gt;Data Breaches&lt;/b&gt;: This is usually the main reason why companies think they should apply encryption as part of their security strategy. Data breaches seem destructive to newly started companies, and they are, but it’s just one of many areas where encryption helps a business to secure and expand. Actually, there are many areas, and I will list them below.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HTSSFWAUA_H1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;Malware Infections&lt;/b&gt;: Talk about ruining one’s reputation. The fact is, shared files without proper security measures are not only damaging to your company but also to anyone who is a recipient of the file. Encryption erases all possibilities of infected malware and ensures that both your company and your fellow companies stay clean.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HTSSFWAUA_H1_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;Loss of Confidentiality&lt;/b&gt;: Unauthorized access to files can result in the exposure of confidential business information, personal data, and intellectual property. This is another area that would be devastating for the company. Loss of confidentiality will also result in a decreased reputation and neglected connections.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HTSSFWAUA_H1_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;Financial Loss&lt;/b&gt;: There is a lot of information that is valuable to cybercriminals. It’s not just the direct attack that is the devastating aspect. The initial data breach is usually only the beginning. With the information they gather from the company, they can expand their attack, increasing the financial loss. They may use the information to commit fraud. Additionally, the company may experience even more financial loss due to the cost of remediation efforts.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HTSSFWAUA_H1_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;Reputation Damage&lt;/b&gt;: Reputation is key to a successful company. No customers initiate contact with a known unsafe company. Encryption is not only for the customers but also for potential partners and stakeholders, who are just as important to keep the company running. Encryption will encourage customers and partners to get involved with your company.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HTSSFWAUA_H1_Text6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;Loss of Competitive Advantage&lt;/b&gt;: Exposure of strategic business information can undermine an organization’s competitive advantage.</value>

    <value>Then click “OK”.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HTSSFWAUA_H3_Text16" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Now your file is secure to share with your trusted recipient. IMPORTANT! You still have to send the actual file to them. You can do this via email, Google Drive, WhatsApp, etc.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HTSSFWAUA_H3_Text17" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The great thing about Key Sharing is that you don’t have to share your password with the recipient for them to access it. All they need is AxCrypt themselves.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HTSSFWAUA_H3_Text18" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;9. Decrypt&lt;/b&gt;: Once they log in to their own account, they will be able to access the file using their own password.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HTSSFWAUA_H3_Text19" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Lastly, for the recipient to decrypt the file, they can either double-click on it or use the “Open Secure” option.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HTSSFWAUA_H3_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;2. Setup an Account&lt;/b&gt;: After downloading the software, you need to set up an account. For this tutorial, I set up a new account to ensure everything works as expected. The information required for the initial setup is your email.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HTSSFWAUA_H3_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;3. Verify AxCrypt ID&lt;/b&gt;: After providing your email, you will receive an AxCrypt ID Verification email. Follow the instructions to verify your AxCrypt ID.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HTSSFWAUA_H3_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;4. Choose a Password&lt;/b&gt;: After verification, you will be directed to the AxCrypt user website to decide on your preferred password. At this step, you can use AxCrypt’s password manager to generate a unique, secure password.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HTSSFWAUA_H3_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;5. Log In to the Application&lt;/b&gt;: Once your account is set up, you can log in to the application. However, you need to select a plan to fully use the product. You can choose between Premium, Business, and Password Manager. As an individual, choose Premium, and as a business, choose Business.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HTSSFWAUA_H3_Text6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;6. Select a Payment Plan&lt;/b&gt;: To use the application, you need to select a payment plan. AxCrypt offers a one-month free trial. I chose the one-month trial and could easily cancel the plan without having to pay for the month.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HTSSFWAUA_H3_Text7" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;7. Enter the Application&lt;/b&gt;: After selecting your payment plan, you can enter the application by entering your email ID and password.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HTSSFWAUA_H3_Text8" xml:space="preserve">

    <value>Imagine a leading software development company in the process of merging with a prominent tech hardware manufacturer. This merger is expected to create a tech giant capable of offering comprehensive hardware and software solutions. Given the complexity and sensitivity of the merger, secure file sharing is crucial.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HTSSFWAUA_H4_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Consider all the parties involved: CEOs, CFOs, and COOs from both companies. It doesn’t stop there—attorneys handling contractual agreements, HR departments responsible for managing employee data, finance departments handling asset evaluations and financial audits, and IT departments ensuring cybersecurity and data migration.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HTSSFWAUA_H4_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>With all this data being shared among the departments, there is a significant risk of data breaches. These breaches can lead to financial loss, reputational damage, and legal repercussions.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HTSSFWAUA_H4_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Another challenge is ensuring compliance with data protection laws such as GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA. They also have a responsibility to maintain data integrity and completeness during the transfer process.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HTSSFWAUA_H4_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>This is why encryption and data security are so important for a leading business. By implementing AxCrypt’s AES-256 encryption system, the two merging companies will have these challenges under control.</value>

  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HTSSFWAUA_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Any company that wants to expand in this digital landscape, which revolves around uninterrupted communications, needs to take proper security measures into consideration. An idea is one thing, and a great crew and leadership is another. But if the company is not built on a secure foundation, the success that the company greatly expected will not happen.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HTSSFWAUA_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>It’s actually very easy for a company to break down completely if this is not taken into consideration from the start. And it goes quickly too. Just one single data breach, or documents ending up in unauthorized hands, may result in an escalating downhill breakdown of the entire company.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HTSSFWAUA_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>“Ensuring the integrity of backup data is critical when faced with a cyberattack. Backup needs to evolve to support comprehensive scanning of files and databases to ensure it is clean from corruption and reliable when a restoration is required. Adding this layer of resiliency, organizations can detect corruption sooner and, in the event of an attack, these verified backups serve as your first point of recovery,” said Jim McGann, VP of Strategic Partnerships at Index Engines.</value>

  <data name="Blog_HTSSFWAUA_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I agree.</value>

  <data name="Blog_HTSSFWAUA_Text6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>There are several encryption software solutions for this out there. AxCrypt is a universally used encryption service with over two decades of experience. By continually adding new layers of protection to stay one step ahead of cybercriminals, they have won several awards and have remained one of the most popular encryption solutions in the world.</value>

    <value>As we adjust to a new work environment that no one may ever have envisioned, the pandemic has disturbed organizations and led human resources managers to rethink how to perform their duties. HR professionals are worried not just about their employees' health and well-being during the epidemic, but also about processing paperwork in a secure manner and providing comfort to the millions of people who have been laid off or working remotely.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ICSHRS_H2_SH1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>An organization's risk exposure can be determined by completing a risk assessment regularly. Regular evaluations can assist identify which employee habits are most likely to expose a company to data breaches or other hazards. A risk assessment by HR, for example, can assist a business in identifying an insecure workstation. It can also show whether staff has misplaced their identification cards. Employee errors might provide thieves with valuable information or unrestricted access to a company's network.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ICSHRS_H2_SH2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>HR needs to keep rules well-documented and ensure that every recruit is aware of them. This comprises protocols for reporting threats, effectively responding to them, and so on, to protect a company and its data.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ICSHRS_H2_SH3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>An attacker can impersonate an employee to obtain access to a system from within, therefore investing time and resources in background checks is a critical security strategy that can help a company protect its systems. Background checks can be costly, and a company may not have the means to conduct them properly. In this instance, it's best to outsource these services to professional security agencies that can run thorough background checks that reveal information that the HR department doesn't have access to.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ICSHRS_H2_SH4_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The human resources department can assist a company in setting up and implementing access restrictions. Even before an employee is hired or onboarded, HR can establish the data that they will need. They must also ensure that at the end of their contract, the employee does not have access to this information.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ICSHRS_H2_SH5_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If a breach occurs, the IT department is not solely responsible for resolving the issue. It's also a human resources concern, especially if there are employees involved. HR is accountable for its employees' conduct. This leaves organizations open to cybercrime.</value>

    <value>HRs are in charge of a lot of confidential business information, including employee personal information, payment details, and other information that, if disclosed, might do significant harm. As a result, HR professionals are in a great position to protect against cyber threats.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ICSHRS_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In this digital age, cybersecurity is becoming a major problem for businesses. When information breaches, data hacks, and identity thefts occur, many people believe that HR professionals, for example, have nothing to worry about. However, for a company to remain secure, every employee must exercise fundamental cyber hygiene.</value>

    <value>Importance of cyber security in the human resources sector</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_IDTRLPVU_H1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Identity theft is the act of stealing someone's personal and sensitive information, such as their photos and videos, names and addresses, social security numbers, and credit card numbers. The perpetrator then uses this information for their own financial gain or to commit other criminal activities.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_IDTRLPVU_H1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>There are several ways in which identity theft can occur. One common method is through phishing scams, where criminals send out emails or messages that appear to be from legitimate sources, such as banks or credit card companies. These messages often ask the recipient to provide their personal information, such as their login credentials or credit card numbers.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_IDTRLPVU_H1_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Another way that identity theft can occur is through data breaches, where hackers gain access to large databases of personal information. In these cases, the hacker may steal thousands or even millions of people's personal information at once.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_IDTRLPVU_H1_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The implications of identity theft can be devastating. Victims may find that their credit scores have been ruined, that they are unable to obtain loans or credit cards, or that they are being pursued by debt collectors for debts that they did not incur. In some cases, victims may even face criminal charges for activities that were committed in their name.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_IDTRLPVU_H1_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>A recent example of identity theft is the SolarWinds hack that occurred in late 2020. In this attack, Russian hackers gained access to the computer systems of numerous U.S. government agencies and major corporations, including Microsoft, Cisco, and Intel. The hackers were able to install malware on the victims' systems, giving them access to sensitive information.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_IDTRLPVU_H1_Text6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The SolarWinds hack was one of the largest and most sophisticated cyberattacks in history, with an estimated 18,000 organizations affected. The implications of the hack were far-reaching, with the potential for sensitive information to be used for espionage, financial gain, or other malicious purposes.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_IDTRLPVU_H1_Text7" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The SolarWinds hack highlighted the need for increased cybersecurity measures to protect against identity theft and other types of cybercrime. This includes encrypting your personal data, using strong passwords and multi-factor authentication, and staying vigilant for phishing scams and other fraudulent activities. To protect yourself from identity theft, it is important to take steps to safeguard your personal data.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_IDTRLPVU_H2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>There are various ways personal photos and videos get leaked online. Some due to malware and others due to a human error. Identifying the different ways in which personal media can get leaked is crucial to taking preventative measures and keeping your information secure. Following are some of the most common causes of personal media leaks:</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_IDTRLPVU_H2_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;strong&gt;Hacking:&lt;/strong&gt; One of the most common ways personal media gets leaked is through hacking. Cybercriminals can gain unauthorized access to your device, cloud storage, or social media accounts and steal your personal photos and videos. They can then sell or distribute your private content on the dark web or use it for extortion purposes.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_IDTRLPVU_H2_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;strong&gt;Malware:&lt;/strong&gt; Malware and viruses pose a significant threat to the security of personal media. Malware can infiltrate your device through various means, such as malicious links, downloads, or email attachments, and grant hackers remote access to your device, including your personal files.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_IDTRLPVU_H2_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Once they have access, hackers can exploit your personal media as a bargaining chip, demanding ransom payments or using the content for extortion. This type of attack is not only a breach of privacy but also a serious violation of your personal safety and security.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_IDTRLPVU_H2_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;strong&gt;Social Engineering:&lt;/strong&gt; Personal media can also get leaked through social engineering, which is a common technique used by scammers to obtain personal information or login credentials from unsuspecting victims. Social engineering involves manipulating or deceiving people through various means such as phishing emails, phone calls, or text messages.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_IDTRLPVU_H2_Text6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>For instance, a scammer can send you an email that looks like it's from your cloud storage provider or social media account, asking you to log in to your account for some reason. Once you provide your login credentials, the scammer can use it to access and leak your personal media. It is important to always be vigilant and verify the authenticity of the source before providing any personal information or login credentials.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_IDTRLPVU_H2_Text7" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;strong&gt;Human Error:&lt;/strong&gt; Sometimes, personal media can be leaked by accident. This can happen when you share your media with someone you trust, such as a partner or close friend, and they accidentally or intentionally share it with others without your permission.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_IDTRLPVU_H2_Text8" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;strong&gt;Data Breaches:&lt;/strong&gt; In some cases, personal media can also be leaked due to a data breach. If a company that you have shared your personal media with experiences a data breach, your content can be compromised and leaked online. This highlights the importance of using secure and reputable companies to store your personal media.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_IDTRLPVU_H2_Text9" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;strong&gt;Physical Theft:&lt;/strong&gt; Personal media can be leaked through physical theft or loss of devices. If someone steals or finds your phone, laptop, or camera, they may be able to access and leak your personal media. This is why it is important to keep your devices secure with strong passwords and enable features such as Find My Device to help locate and remotely wipe your device if it is lost or stolen.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_IDTRLPVU_H3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Now that you know the different ways by which personal photos and videos get leaked, it's important to take steps to protect them. Here are some ways you can safeguard your personal media:</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_IDTRLPVU_H3_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;strong&gt;Data Encryption:&lt;/strong&gt; Encryption is one of the most effective methods for safeguarding your personal photos and videos from being leaked. Encryption involves converting your data into an unreadable format that can only be deciphered using a special key. By encrypting your personal media, you ensure that even if it falls into the wrong hands, it will be unreadable and useless without the encryption key.</value>

    <value>&lt;strong&gt;Password Manager:&lt;/strong&gt; Password management is another essential step in safeguarding your personal photos and videos from being leaked. It is important to use strong, unique passwords for each of your online accounts, including your cloud storage and social media accounts. You can use a password manager tool such as &lt;a href='https://axcrypt.net/download/'&gt;&lt;b&gt;AxCryptâ€™s Password Manger&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href='https://axcrypt.net/information/password-generator/'&gt;&lt;b&gt;create and store complex passwords&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; securely.</value>

    <value>&lt;strong&gt;VPN:&lt;/strong&gt; It is important to be cautious when using public Wi-Fi networks as they can be easily hacked, leading to your personal media being accessed and leaked. When connecting to a public Wi-Fi, always connect to a virtual private network (VPN) to encrypt your data and protect it from prying eyes.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_IDTRLPVU_H3_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;strong&gt;Backup:&lt;/strong&gt; Regularly backing up your personal media is also crucial to safeguarding it from being leaked. By creating multiple copies of your media and storing them in different locations, you ensure that even if one copy gets lost or stolen, you still have access to your media. To add an extra layer of security, you can encrypt your backups.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_IDTRLPVU_H3_Text6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;strong&gt;Vigilance:&lt;/strong&gt; Be wary of phishing scams, which involve tricking you into revealing your personal information or login credentials. These scams often come in the form of emails, texts, or phone calls that appear to be from legitimate sources. Always double-check the sender's email address or phone number and never click on suspicious links or download attachments from unknown sources.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_IDTRLPVU_H3_Text7" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Lastly, consider limiting the amount of personal media you share online. Even with privacy settings in place, there is always a risk that your media could be accessed or leaked by hackers or malicious actors. By only sharing media with trusted individuals and avoiding sharing sensitive content altogether, you can reduce the risk of your personal media being leaked.</value>

  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ITESBETFC_Conclusion_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Cybercrime is on the rise, and educational institutions are particularly vulnerable. Unfortunately, many educational institutions do not use encryption technology, despite the fact that it is a fundamental security measure mandated by rules and policies.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ITESBETFC_H1_SH1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In the face of known risks, educational institutions can be reasonably protected with encryption. Encryption is now a requirement in the commercial world. Encryption is used to protect data in almost every business that deals with personal or sensitive information. Because student information contains everything that attackers need to steal a person's identity and/or engage in other illicit actions, educational organizations, and suppliers that do business with them are undoubtedly the most targeted for malicious data breaches. Cybercriminals have practically unrestricted access to stolen education data, allowing them to profit, cause harm, and ruin lives.&lt;/a&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ITESBETFC_H1_SH1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Encryption protects data in the following ways:</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ITESBETFC_H1_SH1_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;Only approved receivers have access to view the messages from the moment they are created, throughout their entire lifecycle, regardless of where they go or with whom they are shared.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ITESBETFC_H1_SH1_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;Even if data falls into the wrong hands due to a breach of user error&lt;/li&gt;</value>

  <data name="Blog_ITESBETFC_H1_SH1_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;On top of the platforms they already use, such as G Suite for Education or Microsoft Outlook, data encryption from a trustworthy source adds an extra layer of data protection, ensuring ease of use, recognizable workflows, and high user uptake.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ITESBETFC_H1_SubHeading1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;strong&gt;How to protect data?&lt;/strong&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ITESBETFC_H1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Huge Amounts of Sensitive Data are Protected in Schools. Multiple types of personally identifiable data, such as social security numbers, credit card numbers, driver's license numbers, passport numbers, addresses, phone numbers, bank/debit account numbers, medical information, and other sensitive data, are routinely handled by educational institutions of all sizes. These organizations also have access to confidential government and/or business intelligence data about trade, scientific, or military secrets because of their research focus.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ITESBETFC_H1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">

    <value>Why are hackers targeting educational institutes?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ITESBETFC_Summary" xml:space="preserve">

  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ITESBETFC_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Educational institutes have become more exposed to cyberattacks as a result of the greater use of technology for teaching and learning. According to reports( Instead of adding a link to a resource, mention the name here.

  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ITESBETFC_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Therefore, today's schools require a strong and dependable system to ensure the privacy and security of their students' data, as well as their school's compliance with all regulations, in the face of rapidly expanding stores of student data, a rise in data breach threats, and the growing amount of data privacy legislation. These requirements can be met via data encryption.</value>

    <value>When you use AxCrypt 2, first you have to “sign in” – after the first time, that’s just entering your password. Since AxCrypt is a password based file encryption application, that makes sense.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_LYCWAR_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>When you use AxCrypt 2, first you have to “sign in” – after the first time, that’s just entering your password. Since AxCrypt is a password based file encryption application, that makes sense. Even if the password is really the only thing that’s required to decrypt a file, we decided to use the “sign in” metaphor for a number of reasons, among others to make it harder to make a fatal mistake that sometimes happened with AxCrypt 1, which was to mistype the password twice when encrypting a new file. This would sometimes lead to data loss, and that’s bad.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_LYCWAR_Text10" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>It should also be noted that AxCrypt is not really 100% about local device security, there are too many things outside our control for that. For local device security, we recommend using hard disk or device encryption such as BitLocker, FileVault or mobile device encryption as an excellent complement to AxCrypt.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_LYCWAR_Text11" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>To summarize, we do not think think that the “&lt;em&gt;what if someone walks up to my computer&lt;/em&gt;” argument against having AxCrypt stay signed in is valid.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_LYCWAR_Text12" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;strong&gt;We think you should activate your screen saver if you walk away from a device&amp;nbsp;with information on it confidential enough to warrant encryption in the first place.&lt;/strong&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_LYCWAR_Text13" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Happy AxCrypting!</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_LYCWAR_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Once you are signed in to AxCrypt 2, it’ll stay signed in until you sign out, or the screen saver goes active, or the device goes to sleep, or you sign out of your user account, or you power down the device.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_LYCWAR_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>This is done by careful design to make AxCrypt 2 as convenient as possible to use, i.e. reduce the number of times the password must be entered. This, we believe, will make it used more and thus protect more files. If it’s inconvenient, you won’t use it as much.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_LYCWAR_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>However, now and then we get feedback from users stating “&lt;em&gt;But what if someone walks up to my computer? Then all my files are unprotected.&lt;/em&gt;“.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_LYCWAR_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Yes, that’s true. But it almost makes no difference if AxCrypt is signed in or not, if you leave your device unprotected so anyone can walk up to it and access it with your user sign in permissions.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_LYCWAR_Text6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>It’s that simple. Security is about a chain of measures, and it’s the weakest one that controls the strength of the system.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_LYCWAR_Text7" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;em&gt;If you let anyone walk up to your device and it’s signed in with your user, you should consider that computer compromised&lt;/em&gt; and re-install from original media.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_LYCWAR_Text8" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>AxCrypt has always been an opinionated application. This means we have opinions about how it should be used, opinions we base on the fact that encryption is all we do. We eat, drink, think and dream about encryption 24 hours a day. We think our opinions are fairly valid. Of course we’re not infallible, but we’re seldom far off the mark.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_LYCWAR_Text9" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>AxCrypt has always been about real, definable, security. It’s not about making you feel secure. It is about making you actually secure within well defined bounds and limitations. Making you &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; more secure by having you pointlessly re-enter a password a zillion times is not our thing.</value>

    <value>It is one of the most widespread Encryption misconceptions. This could be because we only hear about hackers targeting big businesses, which is also untrue. In fact, Small firms and individuals are targeted more than big businesses. According to a survey, small firms target 43% of cyber-attacks. This is primarily due to their systems' lack of fortification–exactly what cybercriminals seek. You still need encryption, no matter how small your company is.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_MDSCBF_H2_SH5_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Many individuals and businesses avoid encryption because they believe it will be too costly. Again, this is not true. Some of the encryption software and applications may appear to be expensive at first. However, you must consider the future. It's more of an investment than anything else. Consider the financial impact of a data breach. Think about the lawsuits and your reputation; it might jeopardize your company's future. That is something you do not want to happen.</value>

    <value>By making data unreadable by others, mobile encryption ensures that customers' data remains private and safe. Data that has been encrypted cannot be retrieved, making it more difficult in the current situation. The data on the phone can still be recovered even if the owner deletes everything on it to resell it. The only way to decrypt data once after encryption is to factory reset the phone. Furthermore, the expansion of digital payments, enhanced applications, and information interchange via mobile devices generate a large amount of data that must protect from cyber threats. As a result, data can secure from these crimes by using mobile encryption software, propelling the market forward.</value>

    <value>During the projected period, the global mobile encryption market is predicted to grow at a CAGR of 30.55 percent, to USD 5,931.23 million by 2026. Encryption deployments have increased in quantity and scope in big corporations as organizations have reacted to increasingly prevalent regulatory and compliance obligations and more strict internal policies.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_MEWRECY_H1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The proliferation of mobile devices, increased and evolving sophisticated threats, increased adoption of cloud services, and virtualization is all-important reasons disrupting the mobile encryption business. The industry is being driven by the need for strict compliance and regulatory regulations and growing concerns about data security and intellectual property privacy. In addition, the growing popularity of the Internet of Things among many end-user verticals is a crucial factor in increasing the growth of the mobile encryption market.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_MEWRECY_H2_SH1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Mobile devices are now the primary target of phishing attacks. Scammers are aware that people who work from home spend more time on their mobiles and do not take the same safety measures as they would on a traditional PC. Anyone who stumbles across your phone or laptop can easily access the files contained within; however, with encryption, accessing that data is extremely tough.</value>

    <value>Master key is a feature which enables business administrators to recover files of the business members. This eliminates the risk of losing access to critical files. As long as the business has one or a couple administrators who make sure to keep track of their credentials, no documents will ever be lost at AxCrypt due to employees leaving or forgetting their passwords.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_MK_H1_SH2_text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Master Key is highly secure, it can be viewed as an automatic sharing of files with the administrators of the business. Here administrators will automatically be able to recover files which have Master key applied. This feature is tried and tested, and is used by many of users already. And yes, it is important for the business administrators to be extra careful to choose a good password. The choice of password is extremely important, the business administrator should make sure that the password is strong enough to secure the files and documents. Here's the link to our &lt;a href='https://www.axcrypt.net/support/password-generator'&gt;password generator&lt;/a&gt; which can help picking passwords that are both strong and easy to remember.</value>

    <value>When a file is encrypted with AxCrypt, a very random 128- or 256-bit key as appropriate is generated by AxCrypt. This key, which is never really seen by anyone, is used to encrypt the file with AES-128 or AES-256. This key we call the master encryption key.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_PRAA_H1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The master encryption key in turn, is encrypted with your password, and stored along with the encrypted file data in the resulting AxCrypt-encrypted file.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_PRAA_H1_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>This design, which is standard good practice for encryption, also means we can do exciting things by encrypting that same master encryption key in other ways. Which we do, but that’s not the topic for this article.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_PRAA_H1_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Thus, as long as you know the password used to originally encrypt a file you can decrypt it with AxCrypt.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_PRAA_H1_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>We also by default use the same password for the online account where we store your subscription status, your online password manager data if used, and your AxCrypt ID which is used primarily for the key sharing feature.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_PRAA_H2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If you use the password change feature of the web or the AxCrypt app, what happens is that we change the password for data that we keep online, which includes re-encryption anything you may keep in the password manager, and also your AxCrypt ID which is stored as an AxCrypt encrypted piece of data in our system.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_PRAA_H2_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>To change your password, you must know the old one, since otherwise we cannot decrypt the data we store before encrypting it again with your new password.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_PRAA_H2_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>We do not actually change the password for every encrypted file, since to do that we’d need access to every single one and decrypt them with the old password, and re-encrypt with the new.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_PRAA_H2_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>But since we change the password for your AxCrypt ID, you will actually be able to open old files with the new password. More on how that actually works in a different article.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_PRAA_H3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If forget your password, you will lose access to everything ever encrypted with that password. On the server, this means your AxCrypt ID and your data in the online password manager.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_PRAA_H3_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>But, you can still regain access to the web account, by requesting a password reset. This does not require you to know the old password, but it does require you to once again verify that you have access to the email account in question. This we do by sending an activation link once again to that email, and after clicking on that you can set a new password.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_PRAA_H3_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Remember, a password reset only gets you back so you can sign in and continue using the app and the web site, it does not allow you to regain access to files encrypted with the old password.</value>

  <data name="Blog_PYDFCG_H2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>One of the best ways to protect your data is through encryption. Encryption is needed to protect your data from being accessed by others. If your device is lost or stolen, it will be harder for someone else to acquire its contents. Whether you are sending emails, sharing photos, or just browsing the web, encryption helps to keep your information safe from prying eyes. Encryption uses password protection to make data unreadable by third parties and prevent snoopers from accessing your information. This keeps hackers out while still allowing you control over who has access to your data.</value>

    <value>Help desks waste time on password retrieval, and time is money. Even if they tried to memorise passwords, help desk staff members frequently forget them due to frequent changes and the volume of accounts they must manage. Password management using a browser is not secure, and saving them in a different spreadsheet is even less secure since they are typically not synced to the cloud. Password changes are recorded and do not save a company with a bad reputation from the &lt;a href='https://itsblossom.com/blog/2019/10/21/employees-revenge-on-bosses/'&gt; vengeance of an angry employee &lt;/a&gt; who has left the firm.</value>

    <value>It can be difficult to keep track of all the passwords and credentials you acquire as a business owner, both individually and professionally. Protecting the passwords of both your business and your clients makes it even harder. On the one hand, employing the same password across all of your logins is risky and may result in the hacking of your business accounts. On the other hand, because certain employees or consultants are temporary, you may not always be able to regulate who has access to what credentials within the organisation.</value>

    <value>Do you use Netflix? If you have a Netflix account, you have probably heard of the recently released documentary “The Social Dilemma”, which touches on the significant advantages of social media. Google, Apple, YouTube, Facebook and all these tools have made wonderful things a reality. Reuniting family members, enabling effective communication and enhancing our connectivity are only ones of the meaningful systemic changes that this innovating industry has brought. Nevertheless this increasing polarization does not only have advantages. As highlighted in the documentary people are sometimes a little too naïve about the flip side of that coin.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_SD_H2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Everything you do online is being tracked, measured and analysed. You might feel it is now time for you to take your personal security more seriously. It is time to understand the dangers of having your personal information leaked to those who have an ulterior motive. Hackers can easily take advantage of vulnerable breach to your computer and get access to your emails, documents or files to later use it for malicious purposes. To avoid having a breach in your personal data and have a complete online security and peace of mind; encrypt your files with AxCrypt to keep your private information safe!</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_SD_H3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>By converting your private information into a secret code that hides the information's true meaning, you make it almost impossible for an intruder to decrypt it to plaintext. When an encrypted message is intercepted by an unauthorized entity, the inflator has to guess the variables that were used to encrypt the message. The time and difficulty of guessing this information is what makes encryption such a valuable security tool; take the data, run it through an encryption algorithm, and it's unreadable to anyone who doesn't possess the right key to reverse the process. Used by the military and governments, encryption is a longstanding way of protecting data in transit and data at rest as well as restricting access when access controls aren't sufficient. Few technologies come as close as encryption to nearly unbreakable data security. The use of encryption is almost as old as the art of communication itself and it provides confidentiality, authentication and integrity.</value>

  <data name="Blog_SD_H4_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>File encryption plays a major role in enterprises regardless of industry or size and with the complexity of cyber attacks being on continual growth, companies might consider gaining extra peace of mind and security with an encryption software. Files would not only be organized and easily accessible but also safe from threats that lurk in the virtual realm.</value>

    <value>Updates for smartphones must be installed frequently. Updates are primarily intended to correct vulnerabilities as they are found because hackers are constantly discovering new ones. Your phone isn't protected from this issue if it isn't being updated. &lt;a href='https://www.makeuseof.com/safe-use-phone-no-longer-gets-updates/'&gt; People often use outdated phones voluntarily,&lt;/a&gt;however, it may also occur if the maker of the phone is no longer offering security upgrades. Whatever the reason, an outdated phone offers a security risk and shouldn't be used for anything crucial.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_SSING_H1_SH2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If security is important to you, you probably only download apps directly from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. The majority of fraudulent apps are protected from you by this, yet even these platforms have flaws. Because these platforms are so popular, malicious apps occasionally get approved, and they are frequently heavily used before being taken down. Although it is tough to prevent this issue, you can safeguard your phone by only downloading reputable apps and removing anything you don't require.</value>

  <data name="Blog_SSING_H1_SH3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>A phishing page is a website that has the appearance of being trustworthy but is actually intended to steal personal data. Usually, when you attempt to get into one of your accounts, your password is taken.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_SSING_H1_SH3_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Smartphones are made to guard against malware, yet they provide very little defense against phishing.

  </data>
  <data name="Blog_SSING_H1_SH4_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Complete control over what apps are able to perform is provided by permissions. You can install malicious software and it won't be able to do anything, provided permissions are appropriately constrained. Regrettably, permissions aren't always properly utilized. Installing an app entails essentially giving it access to all of your data if you don't limit what it can access. Even with trusted apps, you should allow the fewest permissions possible to avoid this issue.</value>

    <value>Nobody can access a smartphone that has been properly locked. However, there are numerous other techniques to lock a smartphone, and the efficiency varies.

  </data>
  <data name="Blog_STUCTREDSA_Conclusion_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>“While this may seem like small-scale cyber incidents, these threats should be taken seriously given the increased presence of supply chain attacks and the high profile of many World Cup attendees.

    <value>Data involvement at UEFA Euro 2024: There are several areas where encryption and data security are needed to keep the event secure from data breaches.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_STUCTREDSA_H1_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Player data&lt;/b&gt;: Football is one of the most intense sports, involving injuries and health complications of players almost every game. Players endure intense pressure on their bodies, which requires regular health inspections after every game to ensure they can compete in the next game. This information is crucial for every team to keep confidential; otherwise, opponents can exploit weaknesses in their rivals. With AxCrypt secure file sharing, this information remains confidential within each team.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_STUCTREDSA_H1_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fan data&lt;/b&gt;: Personal information is required to visit UEFA Euro 2024. Attending the UEFA Euro 2024 will require sharing sensitive information at various points, such as the airport, hotel, or different arenas. Encryption protects against data breaches and ensures physical safety. If a device is lost, encryption will keep your tickets, reservations, and personal information protected.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_STUCTREDSA_H1_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ticketing&lt;/b&gt;: Retrieving a ticket is not as simple as giving cash in exchange for the ticket anymore. Detailed personal information is attached to the ticket. Banking information, background, health, and more are required.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_STUCTREDSA_H2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>So much personal data is involved in UEFA Euro 2024! Sensitive information we would like to keep confidential, thank you very much.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_STUCTREDSA_H2_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Financial Information&lt;/b&gt;: Ticket sales for sports events generate massive revenue. Cybercriminals can target these transactions to steal credit card information, banking details, and payment credentials. With this data, they can commit fraud, make unauthorized purchases, or sell the information on the black market.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_STUCTREDSA_H2_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Personal Information&lt;/b&gt;: Home addresses, phone numbers, and medical records are highly sensitive. Cybercriminals can exploit this data for blackmail, identity theft, or to gain unauthorized access to restricted areas during the event. Also, personal details of high-profile athletes can be used for targeted attacks or sold for a high price on illicit markets.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_STUCTREDSA_H2_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Broadcasting&lt;/b&gt;: The live broadcast of a sports event is a highly lucrative asset. Cybercriminals may attempt to steal and illegally distribute this content, leading to significant revenue loss for broadcasters. Unauthorized streaming can also diminish the value of official broadcast rights and sponsorship deals.&lt;/li&gt;</value>

  </data>
  <data name="Blog_STUCTREDSA_H3_SH1_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Let me present two different scenarios on how AxCrypt can help protect data at UEFA Euro 2024.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_STUCTREDSA_H3_SH1_Text6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;Player data:&lt;/b&gt; After each game played, players will undergo medical observation. The data collected from this medical procedure by the medical team is crucial information for upcoming games. Let's say the medical team wants to store this information in a safe place where it can't be accessed outside of the team. But the data is not only important for the medical team, it’s also important for the players and the coach of the team.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_STUCTREDSA_H3_SH1_Text7" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>AxCrypt, the medical team can secure all medical folders and share the information with only intended recipients. These folders will only be accessible by people with the correct authorized key. With AxCrypt End-to-End Encryption, teams can communicate with attached information and data without the possibility that it ends up in the wrong hands.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_STUCTREDSA_H3_SH1_Text8" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;Fan data:&lt;/b&gt; As a fan, you will purchase tickets online, entering personal information such as name, address, email, and payment details. Sharing such private information without any safety precautions may result in people rethinking their purchase.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_STUCTREDSA_H3_SH1_Text9" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>By implementing AxCrypt’s robust encryption practices, the event organizers ensure that fans’ personal and financial data remain secure throughout the ticket sales and promotional processes. This protects fans from data breaches that may result in identity theft, financial fraud, and unauthorized access, ultimately contributing to a safer and more trustworthy UEFA Euro 2024 in Germany.</value>

    <value>&lt;b&gt;Comprehensive Security Strategy:&lt;/b&gt; AxCrypt works as cybersecurity to prevent data breaches, secure files, and generate strong unique passwords through password management. All are great things to implement a robust basis of protection on your devices. I want to stress the importance of integrating AxCrypt encryption services with other cybersecurity measures such as firewalls, antivirus software, and regular security audits. Because, just like the players competing in UEFA Euro 2024, when we work together, we are at our best.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_STUCTREDSA_H3_SH2_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;Regular Updates and Patching:&lt;/b&gt; Cybercriminals are not dumb; some could even be called evil masterminds. To be one step ahead of cybercriminals, AxCrypt and other protection services constantly update and add layers of security to fight vulnerabilities. As a user of AxCrypt, it’s therefore important to always keep the software updated to have the strongest protection possible.</value>

  <data name="Blog_STUCTREDSA_H3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Encryption is the process of converting readable data into an unreadable format using an algorithm and an encryption key. This ensures that only authorized parties with the correct decryption key can access the original data. Encryption protects data privacy, secures communications, and verifies data integrity. It's essential for safeguarding personal, financial, and sensitive information from unauthorized access and cyber threats.</value>

It employs a variety of AES 256 implementations to effectively encrypt and safeguard your data.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_STUCTREDSA_H4_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The impact of UEFA Euro is huge, and the legacy is never forgotten. To secure everyone’s experience, extensive data management is required! The devastating effects of data breaches may result in the experience becoming a tragedy. Encryption keeps worrying about safety at a distance, letting love, passion, and presence flourish.

  </data>
  <data name="Blog_SVAE_FinalWord_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In reference to encryption, it is always best to use the most recent systems. It is recommended to always use the most appropriate encryption algorithm in accordance with the task you handle. As cryptography takes a new turn, new algorithms are also developed to reach intruders and protect data, in turn improving confidentiality. Hackers are sure to make it difficult for the experts in the coming years too.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_SVAE_FinalWord_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;strong&gt;What are you waiting for?&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t wait till your data is exposed.AxCrypt app uses both Symmetric and Asymmetric Encryption providing you the best protection for your data.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_SVAE_H1_SH1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Manual encryption are computer programs that digitally encrypt multiple pieces of data. Manual encryption involves extensive user involvement. The files which have to be encrypted are selected and the encryption type is to be selected from the list supported by the security system</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_SVAE_H1_SH2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Transparent encryption provides permanent file-level encryption, protecting against unauthorized access by users and processes in physical, virtual and cloud environments. The application is seamless and transparent to applications/databases and storage. It can run across an enterprise environment and keep both business and operational processes unchanged. It is one of the most secure encryption types available because it misses nothing when using manual encryption. Every executable application and file created on the computer has an encrypted copy that can withstand power surges and protects data even if the computer is stolen.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_SVAE_H1_SH3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Symmetric encryption is a simple, easy-to-use method of encryption. This encryption is also called secret key encryption. It uses only one key called shared key, for both encryption and decryption of electronic data. With symmetric encryption, communicating units must exchange a key to use it in the decryption process. In symmetric encryption, data is “encrypted” so that it cannot be understood by anyone who does not have the secret key to decrypt it.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_SVAE_H1_SH3_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The secret key is generated by a secure random number generator (RNG). The main issue that can be found while using symmetric encryption is that the key is shared between the sender and the recipient of the data. So it is important to be cautious about maintaining a secure method of key exchange, else there are possibilities a third party intercepts the key during the exchange and an unauthorized person can easily decrypt the data.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_SVAE_H1_SH4_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Asymmetric encryption, also called public key encryption, relies on a key pair. In this method, two mathematically related keys are created; one called the public key and the other called the private key. The private key is never shared; it is kept secret and used only by the owner. Public key is shared with anyone who wants it.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_SVAE_H1_SH4_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The advantage of asymmetric encryption is that a secret key is not transmitted. Instead, the public key is published openly.</value>

    <value>Encryption is the process of converting plain readable form text to an unreadable form text so as to protect data or a conversation between two parties or from an unauthorized person. Data encryption ensures the confidentiality of data by converting it into coded information known as ciphertext, which further, can only be decrypted with a unique decryption key generated either during or before encryption. Data encryption can be used during data storage or transmission, and is usually used in conjunction with authentication services to support keys.</value>

    <value>Nowadays we know data is the most important aspect of our life, being it personal, economic or commercial. As we increasingly use online, data is always at risk. In spite of all the best efforts made, there are possibilities that your computer is infected with malware, ransomware or any cyber criminals that your antivirus cannot detect. Malware sends sensitive data on your computer and sends it to the cybercriminal running the malware. It is supreme to keep data secure. This is where technology comes into place.  Technology makes it difficult task for hackers to data breaches. We have to rely on encryption software keeping cyber criminals from reaching our data. Encryption helps in keeping our data private and protected. It acts as a lock from cybercrime, providing an extra layer of protection in safeguarding our critical credentials. Encryption secures our data from hackers reading our information.</value>

    <value>Symmetric Vs Asymmetric encryption</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_SVL_Summary" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Some users instinctively react negatively to the AxCrypt Premium subscription model. Not against the general principle of paying for Premium, but the yearly recurring fee as opposed to a ‘perpetual’ license.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_SVL_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Subscription vs. License</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_SVL_Text10" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If you purchased a software at EUR 79, you’re stuck with that cost even if you change your mind after 6 or 12 months. You won’t get a refund for half the price because you’d like to stop using the software license.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_SVL_Text11" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>We’ve deliberately priced the yearly subscription at a level so 2-3 years is about at the same level as the typical corresponding software license. Yes, there are cheaper licensed software to be found. There are also plenty of more expensive options around.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_SVL_Text12" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Most software licenses are restricted to one or set number of installations. The AxCrypt subscription is personal but valid on any number of devices.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_SVL_Text13" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>It’s more relevant, because AxCrypt is not just a piece of software, it’s a hybrid cloud application. It’s a shared encryption platform which provides a server infrastructure for this purpose, as well as a password manager which also uses server resources. With Premium you also get access to support, which require staffing and other resources. In other words, we do have running costs even after delivering the software to you. So we think it’s simply more relevant that you subscribe to our services, just like you do for other cloud services.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_SVL_Text14" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>That it’s more predictable for us might not seem important to you as a user, but in fact it means that we can plan better for continued development of the platform.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_SVL_Text15" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>There are advantages for the license model as well, but right now we really feel that it’s better for both you and us!</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_SVL_Text16" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Finally, if you do stop subscribing, AxCrypt Free is still a very useful software and you’ll never get locked out of your data if you let your subscription expire so there is no negative locking in. Of course we’d like to think that we deliver so much value that you’ll want to stay because you think the cost is a bargain!</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_SVL_Text17" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Happy AxCrypting!</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_SVL_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Some users instinctively react negatively to the AxCrypt Premium subscription model. Not against the general principle of paying for Premium, but the yearly recurring fee as opposed to a ‘perpetual’ license</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_SVL_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I understand that, but I’d like to discuss why we’re doing it this way. In the end we’re of course always open to change, so comments are welcome. Do use our &lt;a href='https://www.axcrypt.net/forums/forum/community/'&gt;forums&lt;/a&gt; for that, and refer to this blog post so we know your starting point.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_SVL_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>There are several reasons why we prefer an annual subscription over a ‘perpetual’ license, but here’s the summary:</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_SVL_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;ol style='list-style-position: inside;display: grid;gap: 20%;'&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s more honest, fair and predictable for you as a user.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s more relevant since much of the Premium service requires server and personnel resources continuously.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s more predictable for us.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_SVL_Text6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>It’s more honest, fair and predictable because the typical software license is not at all perpetual. It’s usually valid for either the exact version you purchased, or for updates until an arbitrary point in time where a new ‘major’ release is published by the manufacturer. This is typically every 12-18 months. The old release will not get security updates, nor be made compatible with new operating systems, so in the end you’re anyway forced to accept the ‘upgrade offer’.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_SVL_Text7" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Many software companies also offer the worst of two worlds – a license, and a yearly support fee! With AxCrypt it’s simple and clean. A single yearly cost for it all.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_SVL_Text8" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>We first offer a 30 day Premium Trial, and then you can choose if you’d like to use it for another 6 or 12 months at a time and can stop at any time.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_SVL_Text9" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Our yearly subscription fee is currently EUR 30, while most simple encryption softwares license costs range between EUR 35 – 100. With the upgrades being added on top of that. It’s also fair and predictable because you know exactly what the cost is, and that there is a cost. With licensed software you might suddenly be forced to upgrade because your environment changed, perhaps your old computer broke.</value>

    <value>Businesses handle confidential information daily, including financial records, customer data, and intellectual property. Data protection through file encryption ensures that even if business data is intercepted, it remains unreadable without the correct decryption key. This protects both company and customer data from unauthorized access and misuse.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TBFEBSBF_H10_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Confidential business communications are frequently targeted by cybercriminals. Encrypting emails, messages, and file attachments ensures that sensitive business discussions remain private and protected from interception. This form of encrypted communication is vital for protecting both internal and external business correspondence.</value>

  <data name="Blog_TBFEBSBF_H11_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>✅ &lt;a href= 'https://axcrypt.net/blog/what-is-nis2-and-its-minimal-compliance-requirements/'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Compliance&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with industry regulations</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TBFEBSBF_H11_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>✅ Secure  &lt;a href= 'https://axcrypt.net/blog/fundamentals-of-key-management/'&gt;&lt;b&gt;key management&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to prevent unauthorized access</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TBFEBSBF_H11_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>✅ Seamless integration with existing IT infrastructure</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TBFEBSBF_H2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>A data breach can be financially and reputationally devastating for a business. Legal fines, customer distrust, and operational disruptions follow a security failure. File encryption benefits significantly reduce the risk by ensuring that even if hackers gain access to business data, they cannot use it without the encryption keys. For example, companies like Equifax, which experienced a high-profile data breach, could have prevented significant losses had they implemented better encryption practices. With the rise of cybercrime targeting businesses, encryption is a critical step in safeguarding against unauthorized access.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TBFEBSBF_H3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Many industries are governed by strict data protection regulations, such as &lt;a href= 'https://gdpr-info.eu/'&gt;GDPR&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href= 'https://www.cdc.gov/phlp/php/resources/health-insurance-portability-and-accountability-act-of-1996-hipaa.html#:~:text=The%20Health%20Insurance%20Portability%20and,Rule%20to%20implement%20HIPAA%20requirements.'&gt;HIPAA&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href= 'https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/'&gt;PCI DSS&lt;/a&gt;. These laws mandate encryption as a necessary security measure. Failing to comply can result in severe penalties. Implementing encryption not only ensures compliance but also builds trust with customers and partners. By using strong encryption solutions, businesses can meet the stringent requirements for regulatory compliance while safeguarding sensitive data.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TBFEBSBF_H4_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>With businesses increasingly relying on remote work and cloud storage, the risk of unauthorized access grows. Encrypting files before uploading them to the cloud ensures that they remain protected, even if the storage provider is compromised. This is crucial for businesses with employees accessing data from different locations. Secure file storage ensures that your data is protected across all platforms, whether on-site or in the cloud.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TBFEBSBF_H5_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Not all employees need access to all data. Encryption helps control access by restricting sensitive files to authorized personnel only. With strong encryption measures in place, businesses can ensure that only those with the correct decryption key can open and modify files. This added layer of protection minimizes the risk of internal data leaks.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TBFEBSBF_H6_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Businesses frequently share confidential files internally and externally. Whether through email, cloud storage, or collaboration platforms, encryption ensures that only the intended recipients can access the data. This prevents leaks and unauthorized access during transmission. For sensitive communications, encrypted emails, file attachments, and messages guarantee the security of business communications.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TBFEBSBF_H7_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Data breaches aren’t always caused by external hackers; they can also come from within. Disgruntled employees, accidental leaks, or unauthorized access to sensitive data pose significant risks. Encryption minimizes insider threats by restricting access and ensuring that sensitive files remain protected. Employee data security is just as crucial as protecting data from external threats.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TBFEBSBF_H8_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Laptops, USB drives, and smartphones containing business data can be lost or stolen. Without encryption, anyone who finds these devices can access sensitive business files. Encrypting data ensures that even if a device is lost, the information remains inaccessible without the proper credentials. With secure business data encryption, you can prevent data loss from device theft or accidental misplacement.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TBFEBSBF_H9_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Cybercriminals not only steal data but also alter or corrupt it for malicious purposes. Encryption ensures data integrity by making unauthorized modifications detectable. If encrypted data is tampered with, the decryption process will fail, alerting businesses to potential security threats. This helps preserve the accuracy and trustworthiness of business data, ensuring that it remains intact and unaltered.</value>

    <value>With all the above factors being put into consideration, &lt;a href='https://techiespad.com/'&gt;Techiespad team&lt;/a&gt; suggests that it is important you consider using encryption software that helps protect your data. With this kind of software, your data is heavily encrypted; a sure way to ensure that third parties wouldn’t access it without explicit authorization. The password management is also simple, plus you can make sure that your data is safe in cloud platforms such as Dropbox and Google Drive.</value>

    <value>Every piece of information, no matter how little, must be protected against hackers in order to lower the rising rate of internet crime and the likelihood that businesses will be compromised.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TIEDTC_H1_SH1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Employee information must be protected given the period we are living in, which follows the impact of a global pandemic that has pushed many organisations to adjust to a new type of working environment. Every business, unless it is a sole proprietorship, has employees, and with that comes a lot of sensitive data that needs to be protected. Personal and financial information, timesheets and payment for employees, contracts, and sick notes are just a few examples of sensitive data. Protecting such information from unauthorised parties should be every company's top priority, especially when it is shared with external users. Information like this could be beneficial to hackers. Internally securing this data from public scrutiny is just as crucial Organisations run a significant risk of exposure, particularly through their personnel.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TIEDTC_H1_SH2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Every firm will have, in one way or another, information on customers, supplier contracts in detail, and documents about bids and tenders, to name a few commercial data kinds. Regulations governing the protection of customer information are applicable to all industries, but the banking and healthcare sectors are particularly sensitive to them. The relevance of this kind of information is frequently undermined and neglected. Every time information is shared, as well as when it is sent to and from internal systems, it must be encrypted because doing so could seriously endanger a corporation. When sharing such data, businesses must exercise caution because sensitive information about their customers or suppliers could be disclosed to unauthorised parties or even rival companies.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TIEDTC_H1_SH3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The concept of securing corporate legal information is increasing quickly and is quite sensitive due to the data it contains. The volume of data that must be encrypted to be considered legally relevant might be significant and vary greatly. It would cover things like firm policies and procedures, correspondence with attorneys, assets, minutes of meetings, agreements with suppliers or vendors, owner agreements, independent contract agreements, and more. In addition to the necessity of keeping the company's legal matters safely in its coffers, this move will increase customer and staff confidence in the organisation. End-to-end encryption is also a great idea when dealing with highly sensitive data like this. Data encryption offers consistent security for both data at rest and data in transit, which can provide individuals handling the information some peace of mind. Security regulations must be followed to protect legal data.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TIEDTC_H1_SH4_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Most businesses must play their cards close to their chest. Sensitive information should always be encrypted to prevent hackers from accessing it. Financial information of a corporation may comprise its income and expense account, debtors and creditors account, assets, account numbers, payment history, and so forth. These kinds of data need to be protected from trespassers. Every time such data is exposed by cybercriminals, the company is at a great danger of being harmed and the clients and staff who trusted the organisation with their data are inconvenienced.</value>

    <value>Many businesses do not think their data has to be encrypted. They understand the value of this technology for protecting extremely sensitive and private information, but they do not think it applies to them because they do not own this information. One of the biggest developments in cybersecurity is expected to be confidential security. Private information, sensitive data, and the security of communication between relationships and businesses are all protected by it.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TIEDTC_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>No matter how big or small, or what industry they serve, every organisation has significant data.

    <value>you may have confidential conversations with employees, customers and investors, these often involve personal information, you run the risk of unintentional informal leaks, paperwork could be picked up unintentionally, phrases overheard and repeated for example. Legally your firm has to ensure the security of personal data and make sure it is only used for specific purposes. So here are some considerations:</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TPTWHEG_H1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>When working from home you are blurring the lines between work and home. Your usual work/home separation is not present, so you must consider risks that would normally be managed for you by your work environment. When you bring work and the tools of work home, you are allowing many people you don’t know very well, into your home. You are exposing your family to outside influences in an environment, where, they are used to being protected and safe. This poses subtle but real risks to, but also from you, your family and your employer.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TPTWHEG_H1_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Set expectations with those at home, when you can be interrupted, why privacy is important, but remember its your responsibility to protect everyone&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make best efforts to separate work and home life, have confidential conversations with staff, et al in a separate space.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No matter how frustrated you may become don’t fall into the trap of discussing confidential matters with those at home in lieu of the work colleague you would normally confide in.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; If possible have a separate, quiet space for working at home and be careful of working in the garden, fences have ears.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make yourself aware of the personal data you are in contact with both from your home and your work, if you are aware of it, you can be mindful of it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TPTWHEG_H2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>When you bring your laptop and phone home, you bring cameras and microphones into your nest. Apps that use them like video conferencing are difficult enough to set up, use and remember to turn off without even considering hackers and bad actors. Not only do you bring your work eyes and ears home, but you also bring those at home to work. Do you have a home assistant speaker? How many tablets and phones are in your house?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TPTWHEG_H2_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>They all have microphones and cameras that could be active. Your daughter could be on a video call with friends, your home speaker could be activated and listening, you might have left that web meeting session open. You might even be running a video call with a group of customers from your kitchen table and expose pics of your kids, your home address, your kids’ school, when you are going on holiday, and that you will be protesting next Saturday ……. all from what happens to be stuck on the fridge door.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TPTWHEG_H2_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>It is essential that you take these risks seriously, information that should stay at home should stay just there and the same for work.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TPTWHEG_H2_text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be very aware of your surroundings and what you are broadcasting, if you have to work in a shared area, make sure you are not exposing pictures, letters or anything you would not want a stranger to see&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consider the devices in your home, work away from family members who are making calls, work away from home assistants and make sure your conference sessions are closed when finished.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make sure you think about the background, if you are so proud of your home office that you have to post it on Facebook, make sure nothing is in that image that exposes yours or someone else’s data&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consider that your employer could be monitoring you, everything from microphones, what you access, keystrokes, your camera, how long your sessions are, screen grabs, web history can all be monitored and while this may be worrying from an evaluation perspective, when working from home it may capture personal data too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TPTWHEG_H3_text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Having promised this will not be a techno-blog, there are some considerations outside of your laptop that you just need to be aware of. When working in the office your security team will have set up policies, protected networks, filtered malicious emails, applied all kinds of clever security systems to reduce threats to the company.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TPTWHEG_H3_text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>When you are working at home, you are nowhere near as protected. It’s also true that during the pandemic fraud, phishing and scams have increased by over 25% as bad actors take advantage of the disruption caused by Coronavirus. Your home router security is no match for the protection your office has, and, you are much more likely to be using your personal email and apps/games on the same laptop as your work.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TPTWHEG_H3_text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If your employer provides a VPN (a way of extending their security to your environment) use it religiously. We know it’s boring, but do read the security and governance policy that they provide you and abide by it&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be extra vigilant when opening email of any kind. Think about whether it looks legitimate, there have been multiple instances of fraud, making out that due to the lockdown non-standard processes have been adopted and for example, funds need to be transferred to a different account, just this once&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;· If you are working on your home PC, be even more diligent with work data and work emails. In any case do not be tempted to store work data on personal cloud accounts and for that matter do not store personal data on work storage filing systems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TPTWHEG_H3_text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In summary, privacy at home at its core is about consideration, if you are aware of how the risk changes when you move from office to home, and you are aware of the people whose data is at risk from your activities then you will naturally act more responsibly.</value>

    <value>One thing this horrid pandemic has changed for the better, is the ability of people to work at home and the recognition by employers that it’s not so scary to allow it. There are many arguments for and against hybrid working, but now many firms, having been forced to allow home working, are seeing that people do work conscientiously. They are also realising that costs can be cut on expensive office space and they have more motivated staff. Therefore, it is expected that we will see more people working at home and hybrid working in the future.</value>

    <value>Encryption is a fundamental component of security for all the tech tools and items we purchase on a daily basis. All of your files are encrypted by AxCrypt using one of the most secure encryption algorithms available: AES 256-bit encryption. This further demonstrates that our easy-to-use encryption technology is a dependable and straightforward method of protecting your data.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TSTE_H1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>AES is a symmetric block cipher with a 128-bit key length that encrypts a 128-bit message into a 128-bit cipher text. The key's bit size options are 128, 192, or 256 in ascending order. It is simpler to analyse than other devices that only have one bit in and one bit out.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TSTE_H1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Additionally, AES prefers to arrange things in a 4 by 4 grid for a 128 bit, which is equivalent to 16 bits in a 4x4 grid, as opposed to a long line of bits as most ciphers could do. AES replaces bytes, shifts rows, and mixes columns from a plain text by using a portion of its key.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TSTE_H1_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The first component is the substitution, the second is the permeation, and finally, we would add a round key at the conclusion of each round that is equivalent to the first round. But for a 128 bit encryption, it goes through 10 of these rounds, a 192 bit encryption, 12, and a 256 bit encryption, 14.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TSTE_H2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Most contemporary encryption algorithms, protocols, and technologies use AES 256-bit, which is among the &lt;a href='https://www.toptenreviews.com/secure-encryption-methods'&gt;safest and most secure encryption&lt;/a&gt; techniques after 128-bit and 192-bit encryption.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TSTE_H2_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>A 256-bit encrypted message would take two-256 distinct combinations to be broken, making it practically hard for hackers or crackers and even the fastest computers to do so. However, it is also used for sensitive and critical information like financial, military, or government held data. Typically, 256-bit encryption is used for data in transit, data at rest, or a network or internet connection.

    <value>By fostering a culture of security and privacy, encryption has established itself in the modern digital sphere. The amount of data that different encryption techniques can process simultaneously and the type of key required to decrypt data vary. DES, AES, and RSA are the three main forms of encryption, but some are preferable to others. In 2001, the &lt;a href='https://axcrypt.net/blog/get-AES-256-bit-encryption-with-axCrypt/'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; encryption algorithm replaced the &lt;a href='https://axcrypt.net/blog/advanced-encryption-standard-vs-data-encryption-standard/'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Data Encryption Standard (DES)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as the accepted global standard for encryption algorithms. This improved upon many of the drawbacks of the earlier method. The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) has so far met the goals set for it at the time of its creation. Officials in the government and other organisations utilise it because it is the recognized industry standard algorithm and the most secure sort of encryption.</value>

    <value>The Safest Type Of Encryption</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TUGFEDE_H1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Encryption is a cryptographic process that transforms comprehensible and intelligible data into a scrambled and unreadable form called &lt;b&gt;ciphertext&lt;/b&gt;. This is achieved by running the data through an encryption algorithm, like Advanced Encryption Standard &lt;b&gt;(AES)&lt;/b&gt;, which randomly rearranges and jumbles up the information, rendering it incomprehensible and unreadable after the process.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TUGFEDE_H1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The process of rearranging and scrambling the data is done using complex mathematical algorithms using &lt;b&gt;‘cryptographic keys’&lt;/b&gt; consisting of random and unique patterns of letters specifically associated with each encrypted file. Just like the unique keys for your house or car, which can only unlock the specified door of the house or car. The same mathematical calculations are also used for decryption, which reverses the encryption process to change back the data to the original form.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TUGFEDE_H1_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Let's consider a simple example to understand encryption better. Suppose you have a piece of text that says, “I like apples,” and you want to encrypt it. You can use a data encryption software like &lt;a href='https://www.axcrypt.net'&gt;&lt;b&gt;AxCrypt&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which uses &lt;b&gt;AES 256-Bit&lt;/b&gt; encryption algorithm to convert the text into an encrypted form. The resulting encrypted text may look something like this: “v5u8/F28kOazjwQXTxY84+qeweiMvQ=.” As you can see, this encrypted text appears completely unreadable and incomprehensible, making it useless in the hands of a malicious attacker.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TUGFEDE_H1_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>To get the original text from the encrypted version, you simply need to reverse the encryption process, which is referred to as decrypting. Decrypting takes the encrypted text and applies the decryption algorithm, using the appropriate key, to transform the ciphertext back into the original plain text. Just like opening your closed house or car door with a unique key. In this case, decrypting the encrypted text “v5u8/F28kOazjwQXTxY84+qeweiMvQ=” would yield the original text “I like apples” once again.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TUGFEDE_H1_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Encryption ensures that even if someone intercepts or gains unauthorized access to the encrypted text, they cannot understand its contents without the appropriate decryption process and key. This demonstrates how encryption safeguards sensitive information by converting it into a format that cannot be read and understood by anyone without the necessary decryption knowledge and key.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TUGFEDE_H2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>File encryption or file-based encryption &lt;b&gt;(FBE)&lt;/b&gt;, as the name suggests, is a method of encrypting files individually in a file system. It gives granular control over security measures as it allows for the encryption of individual files using a &lt;b&gt;different key&lt;/b&gt; for each file. File-based encryption uses a robust encryption algorithm, such as the &lt;a href='https://axcrypt.net/blog/symmetric-vs-asymmetric-encryption/'&gt;&lt;b&gt;symmetric Advanced Encryption Standard&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;b&gt;(AES)&lt;/b&gt;, to encrypt files and data.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TUGFEDE_H2_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>To encrypt a file, the algorithm divides it into fixed-size blocks and then replaces and rearranges each block using the complex mathematical operations, including substitution (replacement of the text), permutation (rearrangement of the text), and bitwise operations (logical procedure), to obfuscate the original data.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TUGFEDE_H2_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>For instance, in the case of the text “I Like Apples,” the algorithm substitutes each letter with a randomized corresponding value, arbitrarily permutes the order of the characters, and applies bitwise operations. The encrypted result will be a transformed &lt;b&gt;ciphertext&lt;/b&gt;. Here's how it works:</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TUGFEDE_H2_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;Substitution:&lt;/b&gt; 'I' becomes '83', 'L' becomes '=x', 'i' becomes '45', and so on.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TUGFEDE_H2_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;Permutation:&lt;/b&gt; The order of the characters is rearranged based on mathematical transformations. ‘83’ and ‘=x’ will be rearranged in the order and might appear after ‘45’ as &lt;b&gt;‘4583=x.’&lt;/b&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TUGFEDE_H2_Text6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;Bitwise Operations:&lt;/b&gt; XOR and bit shifting operations are applied to alter the bit patterns (arrangement) of the data.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TUGFEDE_H2_Text7" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>This process is further repeated for each letter of the text for multiple ‘rounds’, depending upon the round key size. The AES algorithm comes with 10, 12, and 14 round key sizes. So after applying the 14 round key to the text “I Like Apples,”, the resultant text by the end of the process may look like this: “v5C2uD8FE27A8F5/1B2F9k0AD3zQw8QXTxY6C7D4F8+E6kC2D7F4i91M6v2e9Qi9AbB3” – a completely unintelligible string of characters.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TUGFEDE_H2_Text8" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The whole process typically involves generating a session key, which is then securely shared along with the file during the transmission of data for decryption. The key holds the mathematical model to encrypt and decrypt the specific file for that specific session, ensuring only people who have access to this key can decrypt the data. File-based encryption provides a high level of security by ensuring that sensitive information remains protected both at rest and in transit.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TUGFEDE_H3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Disk encryption or full disk encryption &lt;b&gt;(FDE)&lt;/b&gt;, as the name suggests is a method in which the entire disk gets encrypted. It differs from file encryption in the aspect that instead of individual files, the whole disk is encrypted and decrypted at once, including the operating system and related files.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TUGFEDE_H3_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Think of full disk encryption as locking your entire house with the main door, and file encryption as locking individual safes inside your house. You encrypt disks using a disk encryption software such as Microsoft &lt;a href='https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/bitlocker-overview'&gt;&lt;b&gt;BitLocker&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or Apple’s &lt;a href='https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204837'&gt;&lt;b&gt;FileVault&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TUGFEDE_H3_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Similar to the file encryption, the full disk encryption process operates at the block level, dividing the disk into fixed-size blocks and encrypting each block using a symmetric encryption algorithm such as Advanced Encryption Standard &lt;b&gt;(AES)&lt;/b&gt;. This ensures that all data on the disk is transformed into an unreadable form that can only be deciphered with the appropriate decryption key.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TUGFEDE_H3_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The encryption key used in disk encryption is typically derived from a user password or passphrase. When the system boots up, the user is prompted to provide the password or passphrase to unlock the disk. Once authenticated, the encryption key is decrypted and used to access the encrypted disk contents.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TUGFEDE_H3_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>During the encryption process, the algorithm works in a cascading manner, encrypting each disk sector with the derived key. This process continues until the entire disk is encrypted. The encrypted data is stored in a way that preserves the disk structure, allowing the operating system and applications to access the data seamlessly.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TUGFEDE_H4_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Each encryption type has its features and while deciding on a data encryption method, it's important to understand how file encryption and full disk encryption differ. Knowing these differences can help you choose the right approach for your encryption needs. Let's look at the key ways these two encryption methods distinguish:</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TUGFEDE_H4_Text10" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Each of these differences and features such as principle, speed, security, affordability etc. can be weighed while making a choice between file and disk encryption for your specific data security needs.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TUGFEDE_H4_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;PRINCIPLE:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;File Encryption: Encrypts individual files or folders with a unique key for each file.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Disk Encryption: Encrypts the entire disk, including the operating system and all files with a single key.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TUGFEDE_H4_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;SCOPE:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;File Encryption: Encrypts specific files or folders selected by the user with granular control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Disk Encryption: Encrypts the entire disk at once with all the data stored on it.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TUGFEDE_H4_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;SPEED:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;File Encryption: Comparatively faster as it encrypts and decrypts files individually.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Disk Encryption: Comparatively slower, specially for large disks as it encrypts and decrypts the entire disk&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TUGFEDE_H4_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;SECURITY:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;File Encryption: Highly secure as it gives granular control to encrypt each file individually with a separate key, decreasing risk factors when the disk is compromised.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Disk Encryption: Comparatively less secure and can be susceptible to attacks since the entire disk can be decrypted at once with a single key.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TUGFEDE_H4_Text6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;AFFORDABILITY:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;File Encryption: Generally more affordable as it focuses on encrypting selected files or folders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Disk Encryption: May require specialized software or hardware, making it relatively more expensive.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TUGFEDE_H4_Text7" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;DATA RECOVERY:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;File Encryption: Individual files can be recovered in the event of a partial drive failure, data loss, and key loss using a master key or with backups.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Disk Encryption: Data recovery can be difficult if the encryption keys are lost, and impossible if the disk fails as it affects the entire disk.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TUGFEDE_H4_Text8" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;ACCESSIBILITY:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;File Encryption: Allows selective access to encrypted files, leaving other files easily accessible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Disk Encryption: Requires decryption of the entire disk before accessing any data stored on it, which can slow down the tasks.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TUGFEDE_H4_Text9" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;EASE-OF-USE:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;File Encryption: Easy to use as files can be encrypted, decrypted, and managed individually or in a group.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Disk Encryption: Can be cumbersome to manage without specialized software and hardware.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TUGFEDE_H5_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>When choosing between file encryption and disk encryption, consider your data security needs. File encryption provides granular control by encrypting individual files with unique keys, offering enhanced security and faster processing for selective access. Disk encryption encrypts the entire disk with a single key, providing convenience but potentially &lt;b&gt;slower performance&lt;/b&gt;. File encryption offers higher security as each file has its own encryption key, while disk encryption relies on a single key for the entire disk.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TUGFEDE_H5_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>File encryption is generally more affordable and allows for easier data recovery in case of file loss or key issues. It also enables selective access to encrypted files. In contrast, disk encryption may require additional software or hardware, and data recovery can be challenging if encryption keys are lost or the disk fails.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TUGFEDE_H5_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Ultimately, consider factors such as security, affordability, data recovery, accessibility, and ease-of-use to make an informed decision based on your specific requirements. File encryption is ideal for granular control and faster processing, while disk encryption offers the convenience of encrypting the entire disk.</value>

    <value>The Ultimate Guide to File Encryption Vs. Disk Encryption: Which One is Best for You? </value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_UODPCH_Summary" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In the previous version of AxCrypt, it was sometimes necessary to use different passwords for different files. Obviously you then needed to share the password as well, but you do not want to share your own password.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_UODPCH_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In the previous version of AxCrypt, it was sometimes necessary to use different passwords for different files. This happened when files were shared between different persons. Obviously you then needed to share the password as well, but you do not want to share your own password. So, for each set of persons sharing a file, a different password was needed.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_UODPCH_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Additionally, it happened that users would set different passwords for different files, even if they were only for private use. This may *feel* safer, but in fact at best it adds no security and at worst it causes a situation with *less* security.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_UODPCH_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The first scenario, sharing of encrypted files with other persons, is handled in AxCrypt by the Key Sharing feature. This will be discussed elsewhere, let it just be said here that it’s a much better way to achieve this benefit than different passwords.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_UODPCH_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The second, using different passwords for yourself, is a little counterintuitive perhaps but the truth is – there is no need, and no benefit. It might *feel* better, but it’s not the solution to any problem. One aspect is that having many passwords will most likely be more inconvenient and thus make you less prone to use encryption. That’s bad, you don’t have that added protection. Also, it increases the risk of forgetting one of them. That’s bad, you lose your data. If you have too many, you’ll have to use a password manager to keep track of them. That’s not necessarily bad, but it doesn’t improve anything either.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_UODPCH_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Using many passwords actually tend to decrease the practical security because it’s more inconvenient the barrier against use is higher, and also it’s simply too hard to keep track of many strong passwords. So the typical situation will be many weak passwords. Instead we’re saying that if you can handle one, strong password for all your files, we’ll make it convenient to use since you don’t have to enter it very often. This will in practical terms tend to increase security overall.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_UODPCH_Text6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Security pundits have always looked for the holy grail of single sign on. We’re not there yet, and we won’t get there in our lifetime, but the main point is: Fewer passwords is better. That’s what we’re trying to achieve with AxCrypt 2.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_UODPCH_Text7" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>So, instead of using different passwords for different files, set a good and strong password and use that. With AxCrypt 2, you’ll only have to type it once per session, then you have immediate access to all your files. One password to rule them all…</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_UODPCH_Text8" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Regardless of whether you’re an old user of AxCrypt 1, or a new user, don’t fall into the multiple password trap. If you’re already in there, use AxCrypt and it’s auto conversion feature to quickly and easily get out of it!</value>

    <value>&lt;a href='https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/dec/09/why-did-china-hack-the-worlds-phone-networks'&gt;&lt;b&gt;A series of cyberattacks linked to China&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; targeted U.S. companies and government systems. These attacks, attributed to hacking groups like &lt;a href='https://wtop.com/j-j-green-national/2024/12/the-worst-telecommunications-hack-in-us-history-chinese-cyber-group-salt-typhoon-intrusions-likely-started-years-ago/'&gt;&lt;b&gt;FamousSparrow&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, were operations aimed at stealing data and intelligence. Since 2020, the Salt Typhoon campaign has been operating under multiple names, such as Ghost Emperor, Famous Sparrow, and UNC2286, with each cybersecurity firm assigning a different label to the same threat.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WAYAFC_H2_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>While FamousSparrow has previously targeted government entities and hotels across multiple countries, the Salt Typhoon campaign has been specifically linked to the United States. These incidents coincide with the &lt;b&gt;U.S. semiconductor trade war&lt;/b&gt;, with some attacks seemingly aimed at disrupting critical sectors.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WAYAFC_H3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Telecommunication Networks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WAYAFC_H3_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The Salt Typhoon campaign aimed at compromising the digital backbone of U.S. companies by infiltrating telecommunications networks, a critical infrastructure for communication and data transmission.</value>

  <data name="Blog_WAYAFC_H3_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hotels&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WAYAFC_H3_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>FamousSparrow focused on hotels in countries like the UK, France, and Taiwan. Their aim was to steal sensitive guest data, which could include information on diplomats, corporate executives, or high-profile travelers.</value>

  <data name="Blog_WAYAFC_H3_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Government and Corporate Systems&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WAYAFC_H3_Text6" xml:space="preserve">

  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WAYAFC_H3_Text8" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>While the direct link between the attacks and the U.S.-China trade war is speculative, the timing suggests a strategic intent. U.S. restrictions on advanced chip sales to China and China’s countermeasures banning mineral exports have heightened tensions.</value>

    <value>&lt;b&gt;1. Advanced Cyber Attack Strategies&lt;/b&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WAYAFC_H4_Text10" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;Security experts speculate that these attacks are intended to send a subtle but powerful message in this tech-driven cold war.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WAYAFC_H4_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exploitation of Vulnerabilities&lt;/b&gt;: Hackers exploited vulnerabilities in networks to gain unauthorized access. For instance, hotel systems were breached through weak security protocols, enabling access to sensitive information.&lt;/li&gt;</value>

    <value>&lt;b&gt;4. Geopolitical Context&lt;/b&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WAYAFC_H4_Text9" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;The attacks align with the ongoing &lt;a href='https://www.spglobal.com/mobility/en/research-analysis/semiconductor-supply-chain-disruption-us-china-trade-conflict.html'&gt;&lt;b&gt;U.S- China.semiconductor trade war&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. While there’s no direct evidence linking the hacks to retaliation, the timing raises questions about coordinated cyber warfare.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WAYAFC_H5_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If you think only large corporations are targeted, think again. Small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) are often seen as easier prey. Here’s what could happen if you’re hit:</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WAYAFC_H5_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>1. &lt;b&gt;Financial Devastation&lt;/b&gt;: After the &lt;a href='https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/Colonial-Pipeline-hack-explained-Everything-you-need-to-know'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the company had to pay $4.4 million just to regain access to their systems.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WAYAFC_H5_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>2. &lt;b&gt;Reputation Loss&lt;/b&gt;: Customers lose trust quickly. When &lt;a href='https://coverlink.com/cyber-liability-insurance/target-data-breach/'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Target’s data breach&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; exposed 40 million credit card details, it took years for them to regain customer confidence.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WAYAFC_H5_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>3. &lt;b&gt;Operational Disruption&lt;/b&gt;: Imagine losing access to all your files overnight. That’s what happens when ransomware strikes.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WAYAFC_H6_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Every cyberattack leaves behind lessons. From the China attack and others like it, here’s what we can take away:</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WAYAFC_H6_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Patch Your Systems Regularly&lt;/b&gt;: Vulnerabilities are like open windows for hackers. Regular updates act as the locks.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WAYAFC_H6_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Train Your Team&lt;/b&gt;: Social engineering and phishing attacks trick even the smartest employees. Regular cybersecurity training can prevent costly mistakes.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WAYAFC_H6_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Adopt a Zero-Trust Model&lt;/b&gt;: Don’t assume any user or device is safe. Verify everything, all the time.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WAYAFC_H6_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>For example, in 2017, the WannaCry ransomware encrypted files on thousands of computers across 150 countries, making them inaccessible. Organizations with proper backups and updated systems recovered quickly, while others faced weeks of disruption.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WAYAFC_H7_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Governments are no longer sitting on the sidelines. They’re stepping up with regulations, sanctions, and collaborations to fight cybercrime.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WAYAFC_H7_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sanctions Against Hackers&lt;/b&gt;: After the &lt;b&gt;China attack&lt;/b&gt;, discussions about penalizing entities involved in the recent China cyberattacks are intensifying.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WAYAFC_H7_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cross-Border Cooperation&lt;/b&gt;: Countries are now working together to share intelligence and track down cybercriminals.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WAYAFC_H7_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stronger Laws&lt;/b&gt;: Regulations like GDPR and CCPA are holding businesses accountable for safeguarding customer data.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WAYAFC_H8_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>So, what can your business do to avoid becoming the next headline?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WAYAFC_H8_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>1. &lt;b&gt;Invest in Encryption Tool for SMBs&lt;/b&gt;: Tools like AxCrypt and its secure .axx file format ensure your files are encrypted, making them useless even if hackers get their hands on them.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WAYAFC_H8_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>2. &lt;b&gt;Backup, Backup, Backup&lt;/b&gt;: Always keep secure backups of critical data. If ransomware locks you out, you’ll still have access.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WAYAFC_H8_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>3. &lt;b&gt;Conduct Regular Audits&lt;/b&gt;: Hire experts to identify weak points in your system.</value>

  <data name="Blog_WBFAHPI_H1_SH1_Following" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Most commonly there are 5 types of brute force attack</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WBFAHPI_H1_SH2_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In this kind of brute force attack, attackers try multiple passwords to target a specific set of identities. Here, hackers try to guess manually or use trial and error method, with regards to the user's login credentials without using any software and hence, this method is time and resource intensive. Hackers try to generate all possible characters, numbers and special characters. This method is only effective for short powers, but terrible for slightly longer ones.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WBFAHPI_H1_SH3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Password spraying is a form of reverse brute force attack where the attacker brute force logs into the application based on a list of usernames with default passwords. This attack is normally used in areas where the admin sets a default password for the new users. Normally, attackers try to guess the passwords. However, unlike a brute-force attack, which focuses on a single account, in this case, password injection attacks target multiple accounts at a time. Here the attackers gain access to a large number of accounts (usernames) with a few common passwords.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WBFAHPI_H1_SH4_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>From the name itself, it is obvious - it basically uses a large number of predefined popular phrases or terms normally found in a dictionary. In general, a good password list can improve the success rate of attackers, but here they often require multiple attempts against potential targets. The drawback of this kind of attack is that it is time-consuming and has a low probability compared to newer powerful attack methods.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WBFAHPI_H1_SH5_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In this kind of attack, hackers combine a dictionary attack method with a simple brute force attack. Hackers normally would know the username, so they perform a dictionary attack and simple brute force methods to find the account login combination. This procedure involves choosing common words from a dictionary and replacing them with random numbers or characters. This combined approach is more effective.</value>

    <value>A credential “stuffing” attack involves stuffing passwords that have been hijacked or otherwise exposed by cybercriminals used in login fields of multiple websites. This attack is successful when users use the same username and password combination or reuse passwords for different social media accounts and profiles. Stolen credentials are sold and traded between cybercriminals on the dark web.</value>

    <value>A very common threat in this web era is brute force attack. A &lt;a href='https://axcrypt.net/axcrypt-brute-force/'&gt;&lt;b&gt;brute force&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; attack in cyber security is an attempt to find a password by systematically trying all possible combinations of letters, numbers and symbols until you find the right working combination. Passwords aren't the only resource that can be brute-forced: links and directories, usernames and emails are other common targets too.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WBFAHPI_H2_SH2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The success of a brute force attack is calculated in regard to the time taken to successfully crack a password. As the length of the password increases, the time required to crack also increases exponentially. It is estimated, 15 million key companies would need 9 minutes per second to crack a seven-digit password. A 13-digit password would last over 350,000 years.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WBFAHPI_H2_SH2_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;It is always recommended not to use standard passwords, but it is better to use your own created passwords. The best thing is to create unique passwords that contain at least 15 numbers and several keywords. Long passwords consisting of random words/characters are more secure and easier for password cracking.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WBFAHPI_H2_SH2_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;Lots of websites allow an infinite number of login attempts. It is recommended that the site administrator installs a plugin that limits the number of attempts to connect to the domain, by further preventing brute force attacks. Even a root user can allow brute force attacks on solid shell (SSH) connections, hence it is better to prevent users from accessing SSH by enabling “DenyUsers root” and “PermitRootLogin no”.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WBFAHPI_H2_SH2_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt; It is recommended to have two-factor or multi-factor authentication, where the user must verify his authenticity before granting access to the system. If 2FA is activated, the user will be asked to enter a unique code assigned to a mobile phone number to verify its authenticity, before getting access to the network.&lt;/li&gt;</value>

    <value>&lt;li&gt;A web application firewall (WAF) limits the number of requests a resource can make to a URL space in a given time period. In addition to brute-force attacks to steal session tokens, WAF also protects against denial-of-service (DOS) attacks that consume server resources and block vulnerability scanning tools that check the computer network for errors.&lt;/li&gt;</value>

    <value>Take the time to evaluate your data protection needs and investigate the proper and efficient encryption services to take advantage of the benefits of cloud encryption. Encryption in the cloud is a critical approach to information security, according to security experts. AxCrypt also has a variety of features to meet a wide range of data security requirements.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WCACT_H1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Cloud computing uses the internet to provide a shared pool of data that can be accessed at any time. With the rise of remote work, the cloud provides greater flexibility and efficacy while also lowering expenses. Many individuals and corporations have already improved their operational efficiency while reducing IT expenditures by utilising cloud computing. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the long-awaited widespread adoption of cloud systems, including multi cloud and hybrid installations. While cloud computing brings undeniable advantages, it is nevertheless vulnerable to both inside and outside threats.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WCACT_H1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>79% of businesses have encountered at least one cloud data breach in the previous 18 months, and 43% have reported 10 or more breaches in that period.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WCACT_H2_SH1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The most prevalent hazard to cloud computing is data breaches, which result in data leaks or loss. A data breach happens when a company is targeted by hackers who get illegal access to their cloud network. &lt;br/&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WCACT_H2_SH2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>A denial of service (DoS) attack is one of the most dangerous risks to cloud services. Cybercriminals can overwhelm your system with a massive volume of web traffic that your servers can't handle. This implies that the servers will not buffer, and your employees and business as a whole will not be able to access anything on the cloud.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WCACT_H2_SH3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>An attacker in a cloud system could be because of a client or employee with wide access, or it might be the result of ignorance or simple human mistake. Thus, administrators should establish high-level security designs with distinct degrees of access to cloud services to avoid malicious behaviour by an insider.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WCACT_H2_SH4_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Overly liberal access controls are another prominent cause of data breaches in cloud systems. Proper implementation of access controls within your cloud environment may considerably minimise risk exposure. To avoid any kind of credential leakage, organisations must implement a proper key management system. AxCrypt has a number of characteristics that make it a good key management solution.&lt;a href='https://www.axcrypt.net/blog/fundamentals-of-key-management'&gt;Read more about AxCrypt key management&lt;/a&gt;</value>

  <data name="Blog_WCACT_H3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Cloud users must implement security measures to safeguard their sensitive data from cyber-attacks. Encryption is one of the most effective data security methods, scrambling the information of any system, database, or file in such a way that it is difficult to understand by any third party without the key. Companies can guarantee that only authorised users have access to sensitive data by using encryption and proper key management systems. Encrypted data is illegible and practically worthless without its key, even if it is lost, stolen, or accessed without authorisation.&lt;br/&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WCACT_H3_Text2" xml:space="preserve">

    <value>2. &lt;b&gt;Algorithm:&lt;/b&gt; A decryption algorithm is applied to the ciphertext using the decryption key. This algorithm reverses the encryption process, transforming the scrambled data back into its original form.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WDMME_H1_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>3. &lt;b&gt;Output:&lt;/b&gt; The result is plaintext data that can be read and understood by authorized users. This restored data is now accessible and usable.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WDMME_H1_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Decryption algorithms vary depending on whether symmetric or asymmetric encryption was used. The key is crucial for this process, as it ensures that the data can be correctly decoded.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WDMME_H2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>1. &lt;b&gt;Data Accessibility:&lt;/b&gt; Decryption ensures that authorized users can access the data they need when they need it. Whether it's a critical business document, a personal file, or sensitive customer information, decryption is the only way to make it usable.</value>

  <data name="Blog_WDMME_H2_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>2. &lt;b&gt;Data Recovery:&lt;/b&gt; In the event of data loss or corruption, decryption is often the only way to recover lost information. Encrypted backups can be decrypted and restored to their original state, minimizing the impact of data disasters.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WDMME_H2_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>3. &lt;b&gt;Compliance with Regulations:&lt;/b&gt; Many industries have strict data privacy and security regulations, such as GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA. These regulations often require organizations to encrypt sensitive data and ensure that only authorized individuals can access it. Decryption plays a crucial role in meeting these compliance requirements.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WDMME_H2_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>4. &lt;b&gt;Secure Communication:&lt;/b&gt; Decryption is essential for secure communication. When encrypted data is transmitted over a network, it's rendered unintelligible to eavesdroppers. However, decryption ensures that the intended recipient can access the message and understand its contents.</value>

    <value>As the frequency and severity of cyberattacks rise, IT companies must continue to innovate and lead the way in cyber security. Tech companies, as the first line of defense for all organizations, have a responsibility to stay ahead of cyber risk and ensure that their own security is the best available.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WENTI_H1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Telecommunications providers, software developers, and managed security service providers are all part of the IT and communications sector. According to studies, the IT sector was the most targeted industry internationally in 2021. The most popular means of an attempted break-in was via email, with businesses receiving an average of 600 unique phishing e-mails every month. Since the tech industry is the first to adopt new technologies, making it particularly vulnerable to cyber-attacks. According to reports, security threats against industrial control systems (ICS) and operational technology (OT) more than tripled since 2020.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WENTI_H2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In 2021, researchers have seen 50% more attacks per week on corporate networks compared to 2020. Companies have discovered encryption as one of the best, most efficient, and practical ways to ensure that their sensitive data is protected from everyone, including tech personnel so that only the owner has access to it. In turn, if hackers gain access to a server and steal a user's data, all they have is an unreadable cache of data. Encryption is critical to personal safety as well as enhancing the company’s overall security.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WENTI_H3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>With an increase in ransomware at IT service providers, IT industries can also utilize Zero-Knowledge Encryption for data security which means that no one, but you (not even the service provider) can access your secured data. Even if files are completely encrypted, if the server has access to the keys, centralized hack attacks can result in an unrecoverable data breach. Zero-Knowledge standards enhance end-to-end encryption as it ensures that no one has access to your files and encryption keys in a readable format. It is one of the most secure ways to protect data privacy online.</value>

  <data name="Blog_WEROA_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Our support people relatively frequently get questions, demands and sometimes even harsh words about why a forgotten password means loss of information.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WEROA_Text10" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>To decrypt a file, you must know the password.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WEROA_Text11" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If you have encrypted a file, and subsequently lose the password, the file contents are lost.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WEROA_Text12" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>It’s as simple as that.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WEROA_Text13" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Do not forget or lose your password!</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WEROA_Text14" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If this is not what you’re looking for, you should not be using encryption.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WEROA_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>This is what encryption is about, and what it’s all about!</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WEROA_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Contrary to for example your email, when you use a password with AxCrypt to encrypt or decrypt files, it’s not used to control your access to the files. Your email provider uses your password to verify that it’s actually you signing in, and if you provide the right password, the software has been programmed to allow the access. If you enter the wrong password, it’ll deny the access. It’s just software making decisions based on the password you provide.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WEROA_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>With encryption it’s different.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WEROA_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Encryption takes your password, and then uses it as a controlling parameter to a very complex algorithm that transforms your file to something completely different. If it’s good encryption (and AxCrypt is) the result will be such that nothing about the original content can be derived except a little bit about the size. Not even the size can very reliably be determined from an AxCrypt-encrypted file, since it also applies compression before encryption.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WEROA_Text6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>An encrypted file is actually ‘physically’ transformed using encryption. After encryption, the file is completely different from the original. The only way to transform it back to the original content, is to apply the encryption in reverse. In order to do this, the correct password must be supplied.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WEROA_Text7" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>There is no software making a decision, comparing the provided password with the correct one. The software just simply tries to apply the decryption algorithm using the provided password. Before encrypting, some special values are added to the data, so when trying the decryption, the software can decide if the result is the correct one or not – but that’s the only ‘decision’ the software makes, and changing that does not change the fact.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WEROA_Text8" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Either the decryption works because the correct password was given, or it does not work because the wrong password was used.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WEROA_Text9" xml:space="preserve">

    <value>&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The file data is encrypted using AES and the session key.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WIAAI_Text11" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The session key is encrypted with your password, using a special key wrap algorithm, with AES at the core. This encrypted session key is added to the encrypted file.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WIAAI_Text12" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The session key is encrypted with your AxCrypt ID public key, using RSA-4096. This encrypted session key is added to the encrypted file.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WIAAI_Text13" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The session key is encrypted with the AxCrypt ID public key of any other AxCrypt users you’ve chosen to key share the file with. These encrypted session keys are addded to the encrypted file.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WIAAI_Text14" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>To decrypt a file, AxCrypt in principle does the following:</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WIAAI_Text15" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Take your password, find the session key encrypted with a password above, and try to decrypt it. If successful, the decrypted session key is used to decrypt the file.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WIAAI_Text16" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Take your private AxCrypt ID key, find all session keys encrypted with an AxCrypt ID public key, and try to decrypt each. If anyone is successful, the decrypted session key is used to decrypt the file.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WIAAI_Text17" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The key pair is typically generated on our server when an account is created. The private key is temporarily encrypted using our local system key. Once you sign on and set your password, we re-encrypt it using your password.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WIAAI_Text18" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The private key, when encrypted, is actually encrypted as an AxCrypt file of course – but only using your password to encrypt the session key as above. We don’t use any public keys for this encryption.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WIAAI_Text19" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Normally, then, the process is:</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WIAAI_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Actually, it’s more than that. Technically, an AxCrypt ID is a RSA-4096 key pair.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WIAAI_Text20" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;You sign up for an account. We generate and create a key pair on our server, and encrypt the private key temporarily.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WIAAI_Text21" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;You set your password. We re-encrypt the private key with your password. At this point no-one can recover your private key without knowing your password. Not we, not anyone else.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WIAAI_Text22" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;You sign in with an AxCrypt app. The app contacts our server, and downloads the key pair – both private and public keys from the server. The private key is kept encrypted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WIAAI_Text23" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Whenever opening a file using your sign in password fails, AxCrypt will decrypt the private key, and attempt to decrypt the session key as described above. This will enable you to open files key shared with you, as well as older files encrypted with an earlier password if you have changed the password since then (note: changed – not reset).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WIAAI_Text24" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Changing your AxCrypt ID password in effect means that we take your private key, decrypt it using the old password and then re-encrypt it using the new password. This is how a password change will enable you to open old AxCrypt-encrypted files. Note that they will still in fact open using the old password as well! This is also why you are never dependent on our servers. If you know the original password, you can always open the file. If you have a synchronized copy of the encrypted private key available, you can open any file as long as you have the current password.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WIAAI_Text25" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>All of this key management is done automatically and behind the scenes by AxCrypt, entirely transparently as long as you allow AxCrypt to access our servers.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WIAAI_Text26" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>For advanced users who fully understand the above mechanisms, it is possible to do all of this without our servers. It’s possible to generate AxCrypt ID key pairs, export them, import them etc. We do not recommend anyone to actually do this, since a mistake or misunderstanding easily can lead to data loss or inability to use AxCrypt.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WIAAI_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>A key pair is a concept used in public key, or asymmetric, cryptography. In this type of cryptography there are two, related keys with the following properties:</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WIAAI_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;A public key – this key is non-secret and can be used by anyone to encrypt data. But it can’t be used to decrypt anything! We sometimes call this a sharing key.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WIAAI_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;A private key – this key must be secret and is required in order to decrypt any data encrypted using the public key. We sometimes call this a secret key.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WIAAI_Text6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knowing the public key, it is computationally infeasible (i.e. impossible in layman terms) to derive the private key.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WIAAI_Text7" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>When we encrypt any file using AxCrypt, we do so using AES-128/-256. This is a symmetrical strong encrypting algorithm, with a single key used for both encryption and decryption.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WIAAI_Text8" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The process in principle when AxCrypt encrypts a file is as follows:</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WIAAI_Text9" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;A random 128- or 256-bit session key is generated for each time a file is encrypted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</value>

    <value>&lt;strong&gt;Advantages of cloud encryption:&lt;/strong&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WICE_H1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li style="list-style-type: '\2714';"&gt; Cloud encryption protects data regardless of whether it is stored or transmitted. Round the clock, cloud encryption prevents unauthorized access.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WICE_H1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li style="list-style-type: '\2714';"&gt; It’s not only external access we have to be alert of, but also internal data theft. Business partners or contractors or even employees with malicious intention can either damage or even engage in data breach. Cloud encryption protects and helps prevent employees from harming business.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WICE_H1_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li style="list-style-type: '\2714';"&gt; It has been viewed that APIs with weak security protocols introduce cloud-based security risk during data transfer, which in turn provides unauthorized access to cybercriminals looking to steal data. Cloud encryption services help in reducing the risks posed by insecure APIs and prevent sensitive data from falling into the wrong hands, even in the event of a leak.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WICE_H1_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li style="list-style-type: '\2714';"&gt; The sudden rise in usage of remote workplaces has increased cybercriminals tremendously as hackers insert malicious packets as local traffic and import them into an organization's cloud database using illegal methods. Nevertheless, when cloud data is encrypted, it becomes almost impossible to steal or modify it.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WICE_H1_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li style="list-style-type: '\2714';"&gt; Nowadays, multiple devices are used and transferring data through these devices creates another susceptibility. Using cloud encryption, none of the information will be available without a decryption key</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WICE_H1_Text6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li style="list-style-type: '\2714';"&gt; Cloud encryption is not just a secure solution for sharing and storing data. It is also configured to meet internal organizational constraints and relevant regulatory authorities, such as the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS), Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI/DSS).</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WICE_H2_SH1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>According to the &lt;a href='https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/enterprise/cloud-security/6-cloud-security-issues-that-businesses-experience/'&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Cloud Security Alliance's Cloud Adoption Practices and Priorities Survey report,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 34% of organizations are avoiding the cloud, as their IT experts don’t have the knowledge and experience to meet cloud service requirements. Most of the enterprises have three to four clouds, creating complexity and hence technical knowledge and relevant experience is mandatory.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WICE_H2_SH2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Differences in cloud platforms make data encryption a stumbling block. The cloud platform has three models: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). These models perform different tasks to secure huge amounts of data. As these models are different, encryption methods become complicated and makes it burdensome for the cloud service provider of an organization to maintain and perform various encryption processes.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WICE_H2_SH3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In the IT era, the most dangerous concern facing us is: Data Breach. It is a critical issue which has to be addressed proactively. If data is not handled properly, it opens your business up to huge compliance risks. It is your responsibility to protect your customer and employee data.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WICE_H2_SH4_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In encryption, key management is the most challenging issue. Key management is the process of protecting encryption keys against loss, unauthorized use, and corruption.

  <data name="Blog_WICE_Takeaway_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li style="list-style-type: '\2714';"&gt; Never give decryption keys to the cloud service provider or employees.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WICE_Takeaway_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li style="list-style-type: '\2714';"&gt; Data should be encrypted using random length keys and strong approved algorithms.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WICE_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In the era of multiple platforms cloud services have become the best model in providing storage, computing and networking resources. The survey specifies that more than 2 billion users currently use cloud storage to store various types of information or credential data. Due to the huge usage of cloud services, it is necessary that data stored in the cloud is protected and secure. When data is stored on a cloud, we no longer have complete control over what happens to our data. For example, if we are running an application in a hybrid or public cloud, we are forced to rely on a third party and our data gets exposed.  So, it is mandatory that the best cloud service provider should be selected by one who understands their responsibility when it comes to security.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WICE_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Credibility and security are among the most important obstacles cloud administrators face. Multiple cyber-attacks and security breaches also occur in cloud storage. Hence, cloud security is the biggest concern for cloud storage as data privacy risks grow.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WICE_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Cloud encryption is the process of converting customer data into encrypted text using encryption algorithms and stored in the cloud. It is a data security process where plaintext data is encoded into unreadable ciphertext to keep it secure within or between cloud environments. It has been observed that cloud computing is often far more secure than traditional computing. Using cloud encryption management tools, your personal business information is provided with cloud security, protecting you from access of unauthorized parties. AxCrypt is the best encryption software to protect cloud storage data from cyber-attacks while in transit or at rest.</value>

Ransomware attacks are critical for both individual and business users. Business users won’t be able to access data for their daily operations. Most of the time it has been observed, the ransomware attackers do not release information even after the payment is made, but instead try to extort more money.&lt;/li&gt;</value>

Hacking cloud platforms to steal user data is also one of the cyber security challenges for individuals and businesses. We are all aware of the infamous iCloud hack that exposed the private photos of celebrities. If such an attack is made against the company's data, it can pose a huge threat to the organization and even lead to its collapse. Hence it is mandatory to consider many aspects of cloud security and data protection to keep sensitive data protected.&lt;/li&gt;</value>

    <value>The above mentioned examples are just some major examples wherein the governments of the countries have openly endorsed the idea of using 256-bit encryption for safeguarding sensitive and personal information. This makes a very strong case for the usage of this encryption. This proves that this encryption will be useful in the future as well and looking at how the big private players are after the data of the people, is a technology that is here to stay!</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WIFBE_H1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In technical terms, 256-bit encryption refers to the length of the key used to encrypt (lock) and decrypt (unlock) your data. In the process of encryption, the data you chose to encrypt is firstly converted into a ciphertext from its initial stage of plaintext. Furthermore, when the data is attempted to be converted into a human-readable form.</value>

  <data name="Blog_WIFBE_H1_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The 256-bit encryption tool is the most popular data security encryption tool in today’s time.One of the biggest reasons why most organizations and people prefer to protect their data using 256-bit encryption is the massive number of combinations that this encryption uses to lock your data safe and away from the hacking forces. In fact, even numerous highest-level government organizations all around the world place their faith in 256-bit encryption for securing their data against hackers because it is believed that the key length size of this type of encryption is so long that even the most sophisticated and highest-level hackers will take trillions of years just to decode the key! This makes the case of the usage of 256-bit encryption for the protection of data of the highest-level officials as well as the common people a very strong one, thus earning the title of ‘military grade encryption</value>

  <data name="Blog_WIFBE_H2_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;The United States government was the first government to use 256-bit encryption for protecting and safeguarding their data. They approved its usage on November 26, 2001. They lead the way for others to show their faith in encryption and its capability in safeguarding precious and highly-secretive and sensitive information. Astonishingly, the government there has continued to show its faith in this encryption and the government officials still use the 256-bit encryption for safely storing their data away from the prying eyes of hackers.&lt;/li&gt;</value>

  <data name="Blog_WIFBE_H2_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;Canada is another country that has regularly encouraged the usage of 256-bit encryption in securing the personal data of the government and the people of the country. The government of Canada has extensively promoted the usage of 256-bit encryption to safeguard the private information of the people. This has brought the country into the limelight as one of the pioneering nations in the fight against the breach of privacy by openly endorsing the idea of encryption of data using 256-bit encryption.&lt;/li&gt;</value>

    <value>At an early age, only a handful of passwords were used by an individual. But now, the era has changed. In this digital era, technology has made our lives easier. From ordering food from a favourite restaurant, business meetings at home, online purchases, etc., everything is now possible just at the click of a button on our smartphones in this online world. As and when our life and tasks have become easier, manage passwords associated with these applications has become an important aspect too. The only complication is remembering passwords associated with all the applications. Each and every application or website requires a password to login. Most of the time, it is impossible to remember them all. In accordance with the Google Online Security Survey, it has been found that more than 50 percent of respondents reused the same password for various accounts, which has made the life of hackers easy. According to &lt;a href='https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/list-of-data-breaches-and-cyber-attacks-in-august-2022-97-million-records-breached'&gt;&lt;strong&gt;records&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, there were almost 97 million data breaches and cyber security risks during August 2022. Surveys specify that every 32 seconds, a hacker attacks someone online.  In accordance with the Verizon Data Breach Investigations report, 80 percent of data breaches are caused by weak or reused passwords. This is where the password manager plays the most important role. </value>

    <value>What is a password manager? How secure is password manager software?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WRDBTUAE_H1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Data breaches occur when unauthorized individuals gain access to sensitive information without permission. There are several methods by which attackers can breach data, including exploiting software vulnerabilities, social engineering, physical attacks, and stealing login credentials.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WRDBTUAE_H1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Once an attacker gains access to a network or system, they can use a variety of techniques to steal data, including installing malware, sniffing network traffic, and using brute force attacks to crack passwords. Attackers can also use backdoors or rootkits to maintain access to the system even after being discovered.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WRDBTUAE_H1_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In many cases, attackers use a combination of these techniques to gain access to sensitive data. They may use social engineering tactics to trick employees into revealing their login credentials, then use those credentials to access sensitive data stored on cloud-based servers.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WRDBTUAE_H1_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Alternatively, attackers may use malware to infect a computer, which can then be used to steal data and send it back to the attacker. To prevent data breaches, organizations must implement a range of security measures, including firewalls, antivirus software, intrusion detection systems, and encryption to protect their sensitive data from unauthorized access.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WRDBTUAE_H1_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>One practical real-life example of how data breaches work is the &lt;b&gt;2017 Equifax data breach&lt;/b&gt;, one of the largest data breaches in the history. Equifax, one of the biggest credit reporting agencies United States, was hacked and the sensitive personal information of over &lt;b&gt;143 million&lt;/b&gt; consumers, including &lt;b&gt;Social Security numbers&lt;/b&gt;, birth dates, and addresses, was stolen.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WRDBTUAE_H1_Text6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The breach occurred due to a vulnerability in a web application called &lt;b&gt;‘Apache Struts’&lt;/b&gt;, that Equifax was using. Hackers were ablet to gain remote access to Equifax’s servers, by writing their malware code and implementing it to the open vulnerability.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WRDBTUAE_H2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Data breaches can be caused by various factors, including malware and human errors. Understanding the root causes of data breaches is critical for preventing them in the future and protecting sensitive information. Following are some of the common factors influencing a data breach:</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WRDBTUAE_H2_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;strong&gt;1. VIRUS / MALWARE:&lt;/strong&gt; Malware is a common cause of data breaches. Malicious software such as viruses, worms, and Trojans can infect systems and compromise sensitive data. Cybercriminals use malware to gain unauthorized access to networks, steal information, and disrupt business operations. Malware can be spread through infected email attachments, websites, or social engineering tactics.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WRDBTUAE_H2_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;strong&gt;2. VULNERABILITIES:&lt;/strong&gt; Cybercriminals can exploit weaknesses in software applications such as an open vulnerability or a backdoor, and gain access to sensitive information. This can happen due to poor coding practices, lack of updates, or insufficient security measures. Backdoors are secret entry points into a system that are intentionally created to bypass security controls.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WRDBTUAE_H2_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;strong&gt;3. SOCIAL ENGINEERING:&lt;/strong&gt; Social engineering is a technique used by cybercriminals to manipulate individuals into divulging confidential information. This can include phishing scams, pretexting, or baiting. Social engineering attacks can be difficult to detect, as they often exploit human psychology and trust.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WRDBTUAE_H2_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;strong&gt;4. PHYSICAL ATTACKS:&lt;/strong&gt; Physical attacks are another cause of data breaches. This can include theft of laptops, mobile devices, or other physical assets that contain sensitive data. Cybercriminals may also gain unauthorized access to physical locations, such as server rooms or data centres.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WRDBTUAE_H2_Text6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;strong&gt;5. HUMAN ERROR:&lt;/strong&gt; Improper configuration and human errors are also common causes of data breaches. Misconfigured systems such as weak passwords or &lt;b&gt;accidental data sharing&lt;/b&gt;, can result in sensitive information being exposed. It is important to have proper security controls in place, such as access controls and data classification policies, to prevent these types of breaches.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WRDBTUAE_H3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Data breaches can be reported late for a variety of reasons. One common reason is that companies may not immediately realize that a breach has occurred. It can take time for security teams to detect and investigate a breach, especially if the attackers are using sophisticated techniques to evade detection. Additionally, companies may prioritize containing the breach and restoring services before notifying customers and the public, which can result in a delay in reporting.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WRDBTUAE_H3_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Another reason for late reporting is the legal and regulatory requirements surrounding data breaches. Depending on the jurisdiction and the nature of the breach, companies may be required to report the breach to government agencies, notify affected individuals, and provide ongoing updates on the situation. These requirements can be complex and vary by location, which can result in delays as companies work to navigate the legal landscape and ensure compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WRDBTUAE_H3_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>While prompt reporting of data breaches is important to mitigate the risks to affected individuals and organizations, there are often logistical, legal, and practical challenges that can cause delays in reporting.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WRDBTUAE_H4_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>When a company's data is breached and leaked online, it can have severe consequences for both the company and its customers. Depending on the nature and extent of the breach, the data leaked can include sensitive information such as customers' personal identifying information, &lt;b&gt;credit card data,&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;confidential&lt;/b&gt; business information.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WRDBTUAE_H4_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>According to a study conducted by &lt;b&gt;IBM&lt;/b&gt;, the average cost of a data breach for a company in 2020 was &lt;b&gt;$3.86 million&lt;/b&gt;. This includes direct costs such as investigation, remediation, and legal fees, as well as indirect costs such as lost revenue and damage to brand reputation. Furthermore, the study found that it took an average of &lt;b&gt;280 days&lt;/b&gt; to identify and contain a data breach, which gives attackers plenty of time to steal sensitive information and cause significant damage.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WRDBTUAE_H4_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>This can expose customers to identity theft, financial fraud, and other forms of cybercrime. Customers may also lose trust in the company and its ability to protect their data, which can result in reputational damage and a loss of business for the company.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WRDBTUAE_H4_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In addition to the immediate risks, there are protracted long-term effects caused by a sever data breach. A company may also face legal and financial consequences for the breach. Depending on the laws and regulations governing data privacy in their jurisdiction, companies may be required to notify affected customers of the breach, offer identity theft protection services, and report the breach to government authorities.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WRDBTUAE_H4_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Companies may also face fines, lawsuits, and other legal action from customers, regulators, and other stakeholders. The costs associated with responding to a data breach can be substantial, including the costs of investigating and containing the breach, notifying customers, providing credit monitoring services, and defending against legal claims.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WRDBTUAE_H5_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Prevention is better than cure. Preventive measures for data breaches can help organizations avoid the devastating effects of a breach. A robust preventive measurement strategy ensures that sensitive info is protected at all times, leaving no chance for attackers and ransomware to take unauthorized access of it. Here are some common preventive measures:</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WRDBTUAE_H5_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;strong&gt; DATA ENCRYPTION AND PROTECTION:&lt;/strong&gt; One of the most effective ways to prevent data breaches is through strong encryption, which can safeguard information against theft, loss, or unauthorized access. This can be accomplished through the use of an advanced encryption program such as &lt;a href='https://axcrypt.net/business/'&gt;&lt;b&gt;AxCrypt&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, that protects data across all devices, ensuring that only authorized users have access to sensitive information. Encryption can help prevent data breaches by ensuring that data remains secure even if it falls into the wrong hands.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WRDBTUAE_H5_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;strong&gt; PASSWORD MANAGEMENT:&lt;/strong&gt; Weak passwords are one of the top reasons for an easy data breach. According to a Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report,&lt;b&gt;80%&lt;/b&gt; of hacking-related breaches are caused by weak or stolen passwords. Cybercriminals use various methods, such as brute-force attacks, phishing, and social engineering, to obtain passwords. Once they have gained access to a user's account, they can steal sensitive information or use it to launch further attacks on the organization. Moreover, people often reuse the same password for multiple accounts, which makes it easier for cybercriminals to gain access to other accounts as well. It is crucial for businesses and individuals to have a dedicated &lt;a href='https://axcrypt.net/passwordmanager/'&gt;&lt;b&gt;password manager&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that can save credentials and &lt;a href='https://axcrypt.net/information/password-generator/'&gt;&lt;b&gt;generate new strong passwords&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WRDBTUAE_H5_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;strong&gt; CLOUD ENCRYPTION:&lt;/strong&gt; Cloud storage encryption is a crucial component of cybersecurity measures. By encrypting data before it is uploaded to the cloud, organizations can ensure that sensitive information remains protected. With the increasing use of cloud storage for data storage and collaboration, the need for secure cloud storage solutions has become more pressing. Encrypting data in the cloud can prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and ensure that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive information. &lt;a href='https://axcrypt.net/business/'&gt;&lt;b&gt;AxCrypt&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; integrates will all the major cloud storage platforms such as Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox etc. and &lt;a href='https://axcrypt.net/blog/encrypt-onedrive-and-googledrive-files-using-worlds-best-encryption/'&gt;automatically encrypts data on the cloud&lt;/a&gt;.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WRDBTUAE_H5_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;strong&gt; STRONG ACCESS CONTROLS:&lt;/strong&gt; Implementing strong access controls is essential for organizations to safeguard their sensitive data. To control who sees what, and to limit the number of employees who have access to such data, access controls such as secure sharing can be put in place. This will ensure that only authorized personnel can access confidential information.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WRDBTUAE_H5_Text6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>By restricting access to sensitive data, companies can reduce the risk of data breaches and leaks. Therefore, it is crucial for organizations to implement strong access controls as part of their data security strategy.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WRDBTUAE_H6_Conclusion_Text1" xml:space="preserve">

  <data name="Blog_WSPPI_H1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Personal data has no strict definition, it varies from one country to another and the law affiliated to it is not the same on all continents.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WSPPI_H1_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Personal data is any information that relates to an identified living individual. According to this definition personal data might include a name and surname, a home address, medical records, an identification card number etc.</value>

    <value>Why does privacy matter? This question has arisen in the context of a global debate. Privacy violations as often slight annoyances. Is there a real harm in mass surveillance? Only people that are engaged in bad acts might have a reason to hide and to care about privacy.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WSPPI_H2_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Privacy is a social norm. We put in passwords on our devices and locks on bathroom doors to help safeguard our privacy and even citizens saying they’re not bothered by it use them to prevent people from entering their private realm. The only people who will seek out privacy, are by definition bad people. Nevertheless we as human beings not just terrorists and criminals, all of us — have things to hide. We all need private moments that we can keep out of persistent, insistent and inquisitive looks.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WSPPI_H2_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Personal data affects nearly everything, including what messages and content we see on the Internet. Without the knowledge of what data is being used for, we are virtually helpless in today’s world. The internet should be a tool of liberation and democratization but can be used in an unprecedented way allowing mass indiscriminate surveillance. A lack of privacy and thriving mass surveillance remodels a society that breeds conformity and obedience and submission. Don’t agree to make yourself a harmless, uninteresting and non threatening person not to fear people knowing what you’re doing.</value>

    <value>Information, as power, has some unique qualities and has become predominant in our society. Unlike goods it costs nothing to move around, it can be shared over and over again, without exhaustion as long as a partie is interested in disclosing it. Information is the key to how the digital society adds value and redistributes power. In a connected world, information gains power through permanent storage and wide distribution. Yet, once recorded digital information can exist forever. Data has a precious value when its owner can assimilate, affiliate, evaluate and interpret it. The ability to use data and convert it to information is a decisive, critical juncture. It creates a large and considerable gap between those who can use information as a resource and those who cannot.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WSPPI_H3_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Furthermore, there is an exponential increase in new devices and applications that implement and make possible to spy out a private and single person. This high networked society is constantly changing in drastic manners, so is information fluency. Information is collected by giant data processing softwares and could be put out at one’s disadvantage. Prejudice can be caused in invading someone’s private life and divulging some knowledge in a mischievous way. Following up, blackmail and extortion are then negative consequences. By large scale, monitoring and analysis of the population makes it already possible to draw out conclusions on people's behaviors and use it for malicious purposes. By taking the decision to ensure your confidential information you’re not the only benefiting from it but in one way, you commit and perform a service for whole society.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WSPPI_H4_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The right to privacy is cited in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, in the legally binding International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and in the Convention of the Rights of the Child.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WSPPI_H4_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Privacy rights prevent the governments to spy out on its citizens. The government has a responsibility to protect its citizens, but it often crosses the line when it comes to surveillance. Anti-democratic systems or dictatures might be interested in collecting its population’s private information. They pretend to fight cyber criminality by using an extremely sharp surveillance system but are in fact aiming a total despotism towards its inhabitants. The right to privacy let you engage freely in politics and protects freedom of speech as though.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WSPPI_H4_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Privacy rights keep groups from using personal data for their own goals. Businesses burst in on the scene as well. By knowing what customers are interested in, they search to adjust their advertisement campaigns to different target groups reaching out to you in a personalised way so they can increase customers’ consumption.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WSPPI_H4_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And last but not least, privacy rights ensure and protect your finances. Hackers and criminals are as well very big players in that field. Illicit and fraudulent activities are made possible through data acquisition causing thereupon troublesome scenarios. Without these restrictions, cybercriminals are more likely to steal and misuse data without consequence.</value>

    <value>After reading this article, you can’t say that you didn’t see it coming. Confidential communication is fundamental for liberal democracies. When in the wrong hands, personal information can be wielded as a powerful tool. One of the best ways to protect your data is to encrypt it. End-to-end encryption gives you back control and protects your data from snoopers and prying eyes. Encryption is the best working way so far to secure your data of any form of unwanted access. By taking plain text and using mathematical calculations to turn data into code it is converted into cipher text, only those who have the special key can decrypt your files. Our user friendly system enables ease of operations, guarantees the highest possible control and ensures that nobody but you can access your personal information so that no disadvantageous data breach arises.</value>

    <value>WikiLeaks is an international non-profit organisation that publishes new leaks so to say confidential information non accessible to the general public. Its purpose is to publish original source material alongside our news stories so readers and historians alike can see evidence of the truth. Another of the organisation's objectives is to ensure that journalists and whistleblowers are not prosecuted for emailing sensitive or classified documents.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WTPI_H1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>WikiLeaks is usually represented in public by Julian Assange, who has been described as the heart and soul of this organisation. Original volunteers and founders were once described as a team of dissidents, journalists, mathematicians, and start-up company technologists from the United States, Taiwan, Europe, Australia, and South Africa. As of June 2009, the website had more than 1,200 registered volunteers.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WTPI_H1_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Since its founding in 2006, WikiLeaks has been through several phases. From publishing documents and files that its audience could actively post and edit to releasing political statements related to a specific purpose, they now work closely with news organizations to analyze, redact and publish information in a formal process.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WTPI_H1_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>During the 2016 US presidential election campaign, WikiLeaks released emails and other documents from the Democratic National Committee presumably leaked by Russia. They revealed documents from Hillary Clinton's campaign manager, John Podesta, proving that the national committee favoured Hillary Clinton over her rival Bernie Sanders in the primaries spreading and promoting thereby conspiracy theories. The exposure of these documents caused serious impairs and damage to the Clinton campaign being a potential factor to her loss. The US Justice Department began a criminal investigation of WikiLeaks and issued a statement expressing alarm at the 'multiple examples of legal overreach and irregularities' in his arrest.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WTPI_H1_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Organisations like Wikileaks change society's long-lasting principles and strive to modify high hierarchical systems by using the power of information. Pros and cons being considered, it is truly important as citizens to be a critical thinker and not take everything for granted. Values and purposes are in constant evolution and therefore shouldn't be invariably ground principles.</value>

  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WTPI_H2_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>'Scientia potentia est' originating from Latin writings meaning knowledge is power is a relevant aphorism that can be associated with today's world. This dictum is now truer than ever, as a result of rapid advances in information technology.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WTPI_H2_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Throughout the developing world governments and politicians conceive widely-held beliefs related to the importance of transparency, there has been surprisingly little rigorous evidence on the role that additional information plays in improving someone's situation. The role of information within our society is increasingly questioned. The production of information has sky-roketed in the last few years, one part thanks to its great accessibility as through new ways of data collection and storage. The quantity of information available has by far oustripped our capacity to use it and therefore can be misused if policies and regulations fail to adjust. Quantity doesn't necessarily mean quality. Rarely adequate, the accuracy of information should be controlled to avoid flow of fake news especially regarding political issues.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WTPI_H2_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Rise of knowledge is becoming the key to economic and political input.

    <value>Innovation in information is not intrinsically bad. Information is important and useful to decision-makes. However, access to information is highly uneven.

    <value>Whilst most people are familiar with the term encryption, many have an outdated and misguided idea of what it actually entails. We are all familiar with that movie scene where some guy sits in a dark room surrounded by computers, hacking and encrypting a large organisation's data. Whilst this of course does happen, it is not an accurate depiction of how encryption is used by individuals for day-to-day activities.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WUE_H1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Encryption is the technique of scrambling or enciphering the material in a particular file so that only the designated recipients have the ability to decipher it. Encryption causes the content of the document to be substituted by letters, numbers and symbols to create a cipher. The original document will then only be accessible to those possessing a key, which is made up of the pattern of which the cipher was encoded. Thus, anyone who does not have access to this key will not be able to decrypt and understand the document.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WUE_H2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Encryption is absolutely necessary when storing and sharing sensitive information in order to evade unauthorised and illegal processing of personal data. As stated by &lt;a href='https://theverge.com'&gt;theverge.com&lt;/a&gt;, encryption is a fundamental building block of network security. In 2015 alone, Software Alliance found that 423 million identities had been stolen. This suggests that encryption is absolutely a necessary component of digital life in today's world. Private information such as financial and social security data, is transmitted online daily. Thus, in order to allow this transmission to occur safely, all pupils would be more protected through investing in encryption.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WUE_H2_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;h3&gt;What happens without encryption?&lt;/h3&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WUE_H2_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In some industries, not encrypting sensitive material is punishable. For example, the Greater Manchester Police was allocated a penalty of £150,000 when an unencrypted USB stick was stolen from an officers home. The USB contained information regarding current police investigations and included private information of over 1,000 individuals. The stick was not password protected and completely unencrypted.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WUE_H3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In this case, had the files in question been encrypted, the 1,000 individuals whose information was on the stick would not have been put in danger, and the police would not have been handed the penalty.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WUE_H4_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Here at AxCrypt we use Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), which is an encryption algorithm that is largely considered to be the most secure of those available. The AxCrypt Premium and Business subscription services provide 256-bit encryption, which presents security that is virtually impossible to bypass. It would take millions of years to crack it even for the fastest available computers!</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WUE_H5_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>So in short, we need encryption because as private users or companies we are dealing with massive data breaches, increasing in every passing day. Encryption securely protects data that you don't want anyone else to have access. It can help protect data you send, receive, and store such as text messages stored on your smartphone, running logs saved on your fitness watch, and banking information sent through your online account.</value>

  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WUE_Heading3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The penalty was issued under the pretence that the Greater Manchester Police had failed to introduce convenient technical procedures for the loss of private information. There had been an order which required employees to use encrypted memory sticks, however this rule was never enforced and there were no restrictions on the downloading of material onto external hard drives.</value>

    <value>AxCrypt 2 no longer supports a feature called Self Decrypting Files that was supported in AxCrypt 1.x. What’s a Self Decrypting File? It’s a two things in one: It’s a self-contained executable program (a .exe), with secured data (a .axx file) embedded or appended to it.</value>

  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WYSASDF_Text10" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;Although legacy AxCrypt 1.x self decrypting files had some safeguards against misuse, i.e. encrypting malware to get past firewalls and email filters, it’s still risky business. We do not want to create the perfect toolkit and carrier for malware.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WYSASDF_Text11" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;Another use case is self-contained backups. That’s not a bad idea in theory, but Windows has a hard limit of 2GB size of any .exe , so large backups are not possible to do in this way.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WYSASDF_Text12" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>All in all, there are simply too many things that speak against &lt;em&gt;Self Decrypting Files&lt;/em&gt;. But we did something better!</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WYSASDF_Text13" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>With AxCrypt 2 we created a fully featured standalone, install-free version instead of the extremely limited self-decrypter of AxCrypt 1. This can be used for all scenarios where the self decryptor was used, with minimal extra work.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WYSASDF_Text14" xml:space="preserve">

  <data name="Blog_WYSASDF_Text15" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>So, instead of wishing for the fundamentally broken idea of &lt;em&gt;Self Decrypting Files&lt;/em&gt;, just embrace the new key sharing technology, and provide the recipient with a &lt;a href='https://account.axcrypt.net/Download/AxCrypt-2.exe'&gt;link to the standalone executable&lt;/a&gt; . If you have a channel that can transmit executables, download it and send it there with the file.</value>

  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WYSASDF_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>When the recipient gets the &lt;em&gt;Self Decrypting File&lt;/em&gt;, (s)he then double-clicks it to run it.

    <value>&lt;li&gt;The self decryptor is an executable program that can contain anything, and the recipient has to trust that it does what the sender claims it does. This is not something the recipient should do lightly.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WYSASDF_Text6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;Since it by definition contains strongly encrypted information, for example another executable software, it is impossible to screen by anti virus software. It can literally contain any level of bad.&lt;/li&gt;</value>

  <data name="Blog_WYSASDF_Text7" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;What’s the only reasonable thing to do with something that can contain any kind of malevolent executable software? To block it with prejudice of course!&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WYSASDF_Text8" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;Most email providers and clients will refuse to send and/or receive attachments that are executable softwares (.exe, .bat, .cmd, .com, etc). That’s a good thing! But bad for even honest self decryptors.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WYSASDF_Text9" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;The legacy AxCrypt 1.x encryption only supports passwords, so you still have the problem of transmitting the password to the recipient. If you have more than one recipient, this quickly gets completely out of hand.&lt;/li&gt;</value>

    <value>Before we understand what Zero-Knowledge Encryption is, first, let’s quickly understand what does data or file encryption mean. File encryption is a process where the contents of a file are transformed into an unreadable and undecipherable format using complex mathematical algorithms and cryptographic keys.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ZKEEIST_H1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>During the file encryption process, the algorithm rearranges, shifts, mixes, and transforms the contents of the files into a random formation of strings. The cryptographic keys determine the exact order or steps of these arrangements, which can be used to reverse the encryption process to convert the contents of the files back to their original forms.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ZKEEIST_H1_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Zero-knowledge encryption is an encryption type that ensures that the data is encrypted before it reaches a service provider such as an encryption cloud storage – thus the name ‘Zero Knowledge’. Zero-knowledge encryption ensures that only the end user has access to the cryptographic keys, and the service provider cannot decrypt the data, even if they have access to it. This is important for protecting sensitive data, such as financial information or medical records.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ZKEEIST_H2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Zero-Knowledge encryption matters for your data because it provides a high level of security that is not available with other encryption methods. With Zero-Knowledge encryption, no one but you have the ability to decrypt your data, even if they have the encrypted file. This is because Zero-Knowledge encryption uses a cryptographic key that is only known to you</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ZKEEIST_H2_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The key is never shared with anyone, not even the service provider that is hosting your encrypted data. This means that even if a hacker were to gain access to your encrypted data, they would not be able to decrypt it without the keys.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ZKEEIST_H2_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Zero-Knowledge encryption is an excellent choice for securing sensitive data, such as financial information, medical records, and intellectual property. It is also a good choice for data that you want to keep private, such as personal photos or videos.</value>

    <value>2023 was a pivotal year for the advancements in the technology and IT sector. With expeditious developments in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, launching a cyber attack has become easier than ever.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ZKEEIST_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In 2023, there were a total of &lt;a href='https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/list-of-data-breaches-and-cyber-attacks-in-2023'&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6 billion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; compromised records with &lt;a href='https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/list-of-data-breaches-and-cyber-attacks-in-2023'&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1,404&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; breach incidents, amounting to almost 4 breaches per day! Darkbeam was the largest data breach of 2023, with over &lt;a href='https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37684884'&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.8 billion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; records leaked. Statistics like these cannot be taken on a lighter note, especially when your sensitive data and that of your organization are involved.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ZKEEIST_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>However, the good news is that sensitive data can be proactively shielded from cyber attacks using powerful data encryption techniques. Encrypting data with Zero-Knowledge encryption ensures that even if data is leaked during a breach, it cannot be deciphered and cannot be made use of without the proper decryption keys.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ZKEEIST_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In this blog post, let’s discuss what data encryption with zero-knowledge encryption is, why it’s important for data security, how to use it, and its effective use cases</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ZKEEIST_Title" xml:space="preserve">

  <data name="Blog_ZTCS_Conclusion_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;strong&gt;Why is Zero Trust needed? &lt;/strong&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ZTCS_Conclusion_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Due to the pandemic, Zero Trust has stepped up its game. Since now companies have begun to decentralize their data, assets, applications, and services (DAAS) to different individuals through cloud infrastructure providers. And the fact that internal factors are responsible for 30% of data breaches today, the Zero Trust framework was created, to assist digital businesses in securing valuable assets. As per the Zero Trust model, trust is vulnerability. It indicates that no user, even if they are an employee, can be trusted.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ZTCS_Conclusion_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>According to studies, Zero Trust methods result in 50% fewer breaches and 40% less technology spending since everything is interconnected. Companies that embraced Zero Trust were twice as confident in their capacity to bring innovative business models and consumer experiences to market.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ZTCS_H1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The primary objective of the Zero Trust model is to minimize the possibility of remote work risks and insider threats, as well as to control third-party interference and cloud risk. The model is a significant shift from the castle-and-moat strategy, which focuses on strengthening the perimeter around the data to keep outsiders out while implicitly trusting insiders. The Zero Trust concept is simple and straightforward: Never trust; always verify. This implies that before any data can be accessed, each user must be validated. Every user request, whether within or outside the company, must be verified and approved in real-time.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ZTCS_H2_SH1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The framework of the Zero Trust model is based on verification before trustworthiness; therefore user identification as well as device identity and security, are all validated at multiple stages. Once established, logins and connections time out periodically, requiring users and devices to be re-verified on a regular basis.&lt;br/&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ZTCS_H2_SH2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Zero Trust entails granting users only the level of access they require, reducing each user's exposure to the network's vulnerable areas. This requires careful management of user permissions.&lt;br/&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ZTCS_H2_SH3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The Zero Trust system keeps track of how many different devices are attempting to connect to their network, verifies that each one is allowed, and assesses each one to certify it hasn't been hacked; while using MFA to authenticate each user by means of 2-factor authorization. These factors reduce the network's attack surface even further.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ZTCS_H2_SH4_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Micro-segmentation is the method adopted by Zero Trust of dividing security perimeters into small distinct zones so that different sections of the network can have independent access. Without additional authorization, a person or program with access to one of the zone will not be able to access any of the others; thus effectively preventing lateral movement from unknown attackers.</value>

    <value>Zero Trust secures remote workforces better than traditional approaches, and the benefits go beyond security to boost productivity and agility. In this article, we'll look at some of Zero Trust's most important security features.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ZTCS_H3_SH1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Key sharing enables you to collaborate and connect with other members without jeopardizing the confidentiality of your data.  Using AxCrypt's key sharing function you can give anyone data access and withdraw it whenever you want; you don't even have to disclose your own password. For more info on AxCrypt key sharing check our key sharing tutorial on&lt;a href=' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUVWbmiEFSs'&gt; YouTube &lt;/a&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ZTCS_H3_SH2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Master Key is highly secure, it can be viewed as an automatic sharing of files with the administrators of the business. It allows business managers to recover files from other members of the company. This avoids the possibility of losing vital files.&lt;a href='https://axcrypt.net/blog/master-key/'&gt; Read more about AxCrypt's master key feature here&lt;/a&gt;</value>

    <value>The advantages of using a Zero Trust architecture extend well beyond security. All of this, however, might be in vain if it is not successfully executed. This model is all about encryption and access control, both of which rely on cryptography. Cryptography, in turn, is based on keys. Cryptography's protection will be rendered useless if a key is compromised. As a result, keys must be kept secure at all times and maintained correctly for optimal security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</value>

    <value>Educational institutions today are increasingly digital, extensive, and accessible, with more universities, colleges, and schools experiencing a rapid surge in the volume of sensitive data they handle. From students' personal information and academic records to groundbreaking research documents, educational institutions today have a substantial amount of sensitive data to care for. &lt;br/&gt; However, this expeditious shift towards digitalization within educational institutions has also exposed them to new vulnerabilities and risks to their data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In 2020, education was the most targeted sector among data breaches. A devastating data breach could potentially  lead to severe ramifications for educational institutions. Not only could it jeopardize the confidentiality and privacy of students, faculty, and staff, but it can also result in financial losses, damage to the institution's reputation, and legal repercussions.</value>

  <data name="FaqAccessDenied" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Why do I get ‘Access Denied’ and/or my file names are in green text?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqAccessDeniedAnswer1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>AxCrypt is accessed via the right-click context menu, under the heading ‘AxCrypt’. There is also a built-in encryption in some versions of Windows, which is accessed in a similar way, but under the heading ‘Properties’, then the button ‘Advanced’ and finally the check box ‘Encrypt contents to secure data’. This encryption uses a feature called &lt;a href='https://support.microsoft.com/windows'&gt;Encrypting File System&lt;/a&gt;, or EFS for short.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqAccessDeniedAnswer2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>There are typically two reasons for getting ‘Access Denied’ messages. Both occur when files are either moved to a new system, or Windows is (re)installed on an existing system. One situation is a problem, the other is not.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqAccessDeniedAnswer3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If the file names in Windows Explorer are shown in black text, then you’re likely just having an NTFS ownership issue, and this is easily remedied. Please Google for ‘ntfs take ownership’ (without the quotes) to find suggested solutions.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqAccessDeniedAnswer4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If the file names in Windows Explorer are shown in green text, then you’ve inadvertently encrypted them with EFS. This might mean your files are lost. Please Google for ‘efs access denied’ for explanations and possible remedies.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqAccessDeniedAnswer5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>EFS may in some cases be a useful feature, and can for some scenarios be a better solution than AxCrypt. However... Beware: There be Dragons!</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqAccessDeniedAnswer6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Because of the way EFS is implemented, it is also likely to be the single most common cause of data loss in Windows environments. If you’re a computer security wizard, and have a full understanding of X.509 encryption certificates, and how the Windows Certificate Stores work and interact with user credentials, then you won’t have a problem as long as you’re careful to ensure backups of the appropriate certificates and keys. If, however, the previous sentence confuses you then you should probably not be using EFS because of the mentioned risk of data loss when moving files to a new system, or (re)installing Windows, or resetting passwords, or…</value>

  <data name="FaqAnyoneCanDeleteFileAnswer1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Securing a file with AxCrypt protects your information from prying eyes and undetected modification or corruption. It does not protect against destruction, willfully or by accident.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqAnyoneCanDeleteFileAnswer2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>It bears repetition: Your protection against data loss is regular backups.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqAnyoneCanDeleteFileAnswer3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Technically it’s not really possible to reliably protect your data against destruction with software – except backup software. Of course, software can add safeguards that make it harder to do it by mistake, or even maliciously but in the end you can’t protect against vandals that way.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqAnyoneCanDeleteFileAnswer4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>You should be using the NTFS file system and let every user of the computer sign in as a separate, restricted, user. No-one should normally run as administrator. This will protect your files against deletion by other users of the same computer, but it will not protect against yourself – or any agent acting on your behalf. Please remember that viruses and trojan intrusions will be acting as if on the behalf of the compromised user!</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqAnyoneCanDeleteFileAnswer5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If your system is compromised by a virus or a trojan, your secured files will be protected from theft – but not from destruction.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqAnyoneCanDeleteFileAnswer6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>AxCrypt is not intended to protect against destruction, and there is to our knowledge no such serious software available except backup software. Any software claiming to provide such protection should be examined carefully to understand exactly what it is it protects against and how. Always backup your data regardless of other measures taken.</value>

    <value>If your secured file is corrupt, you will get a message which will refer to the HMAC being incorrect or some similar text.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqDamagedFileAnswer2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>This message implies that the file is recognized by AxCrypt, and that you have entered the correct password and/or key file, and there is hope!</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqDamagedFileAnswer3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Another message that may be seen will refer to the GUID being incorrect. This indicates a severe error in the file to the extent that it’s not even recognized as an AxCrypt file. In most cases this is because the file is simply not a file secured by AxCrypt.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqDamagedFileAnswer4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>AxCrypt has some features for recovery of damaged files, but there are some limitations. You must also be careful, and start by marking the original (damaged) file as read-only, and then make a copy of it – and always only work on the copy!</value>

    <value>What is the difference between AxCrypt 1.x and 2.x?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqDifference1&amp;2Answer1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>AxCrypt 1.x is a legacy version. That means it is outdated and there is no longer any support for it, whereas AxCrypt 2.x is the version that we are continuously working on to keep improving it. It’s absolutely not recommended to use 1.x. We recommend all users, old and new, to always use the most current released version of AxCrypt, which can be downloaded &lt;a href='/download'&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.</value>

  </data>
  <data name="FaqDifferenceStandaloneInstallerAnswer2" xml:space="preserve">

    <value>Your email will be used to name your AxCrypt ID, and will also be used as the name when authenticating against the server in order to access premium functionality. It may also be used to notify you of critical software updates, new features and other communications from us such as a newsletter. The AxCrypt ID itself will be used to allow others to share files securely with you without the need to share passwords, and for other possible future features such as enabling others to validate digital signatures. Since we offer premium features from a server based infrastructure, we need something to identify you by. Currently this is your email since it is universally available and accepted.

    <value>If you get an error message “File Encryption for .NET and Mono has stopped working. A problem caused the program to stop working correctly. Windows will close the program and notify you if a solution is available.” the most likely cause is a software called “Lavasoft Web Companion”. This is not compatible with modern versions of Windows, and it modifies the way the network is accessed in a way that causes AxCrypt and other programs to crash.</value>

    <value>I forgot my password. What to do?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqForgotPasswordAnswer1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The basic rule is: If you lose or forget your password or key-file, your documents are lost. There is no back-door into AxCrypt.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqForgotPasswordAnswer2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The only way to recover a lost password is to try all likely combinations.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqForgotPasswordAnswer3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>All that being said, there is a special case where we could possibly help you. If you think you know your password, but not quite, or if it’s less than 5 characters long – then we can write and adapt a special program that will try many combinations automatically. This is called a brute force attack.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqForgotPasswordAnswer4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>AxCrypt is specifically engineered to counter &lt;a href='/axcrypt-brute-force'&gt;&lt;strong&gt;brute force&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; attacks, and does it rather well, so this will only work when the number of combinations to try is very small, let’s say less than a million.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqForgotPasswordAnswer5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If you think you may be in a position where you can narrow down the possible combinations enough for us, then there is a slight chance to recover the password using a utility that will attempt to try many possibilities according to a pattern you provide. Please &lt;a href="mailto:support@axcrypt.net"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;contact support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; if would like to try the brute force utility.</value>

    <value>How many passes does wipe do/Why only one pass wiping?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqHowManyWipeAnswer1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Wipe and Delete only overwrites once with pseudo random data. We’re currently not planning to implement DoD 5220.22 (NISPOM) sanitization, nor Gutmann 35-pass secure-wipe. The cost of retrieving single-overwritten data is prohibitive as it is. If the attacker has the resources for that (as well as getting physical access to the disk) there are many easier and surer ways of getting at the data.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqHowManyWipeAnswer2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>A PC is such an insecure and uncontrolled environment, that to use DoD-style wiping in a running system is severe overkill and misleading. Such wiping should be used prior to destruction or re-use of hard disks, and then only from a stand-alone diskette and CD so that the entire disk surface may be wiped, regardless of operating system structures. We recommend Boot and Nuke for this purpose.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqHowManyWipeAnswer3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The purpose of AxCrypt wiping is to protect from use of common undelete tools, not to protect from electron microscopy or special diagnostic hardware and software available to hard disc manufacturers. Wiping 35 times also takes a lot of time...</value>

  <data name="FaqHowToRenew" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>How do I renew my subscription?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqHowToRenewAnswer1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>New subscribers have a subscription that will automatically renew at the end of the subscription period, using the initial payment method. To check your subscription status, login to the account site, and check it on the &lt;a href='https://account.axcrypt.net/en/Home/Login'&gt;My AxCrypt ID page&lt;/a&gt;. You will see the date it renews on there.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqHowToRenewAnswer2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If it mentions that the subscription will expire on a certain date, you either subscribed before June 25th 2020, or you cancelled your automatic payments. In that case, you will have to renew it yourself.</value>

  <data name="FaqKeysAndPasswordsAnswer1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Yes, but encrypted with your password which we do not store. There is no essential change in the security compared to previous versions. You must still use a strong password, and keep it secret.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqKeysAndPasswordsAnswer2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The only thing that must be secret with AxCrypt is your password. Nothing else, not the software, not the secured files, not the secured account keys or anything else. As long as your password is both strong and secret, your secured files remain secure. Even if our server would be compromised, the permanently stored sensitive data stored there is encrypted with your password, which we do not store.</value>

  <data name="FaqPasswordRecoveryCorporate" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Does AxCrypt support password recovery for corporate use?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqPasswordRecoveryCorporateAnswer1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If you represent a company thinking about using AxCrypt, you may be worried about the case of an employee quitting and not telling the password to his or her files. The question then is if you can set a password recovery policy?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqPasswordRecoveryCorporateAnswer2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If an employee quits, and refuses to give back company property your response should be to report the person to the police for theft, and/or take other legal action. This applies just as much to his laptop as the intellectual property owned by the company which is stored on the laptop or the company servers.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqPasswordRecoveryCorporateAnswer3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>There are enterprise solutions that do implement functionality like this, but the most common reason to use AxCrypt is because of it’s simplicity to implement. Enterprise solutions demand quite a bit of infrastructure, maintenance and can be quite complex to install. Unfortunately, enterprise solutions do not really protect against disgruntled (ex-) employees anyway, although they do provide protection against accidental password loss.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqPasswordRecoveryCorporateAnswer4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>So, AxCrypt is kept simple to use and deploy, at the cost of no password recovery. Data loss concerns should be addressed via backup procedures of both passwords and data, and issues with employees leaving without divulging passwords should be treated as any other destructive or illegal behavior by such a person.</value>

  <data name="FaqSignInWithoutPasswordAnswer1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If you’ve just downloaded AxCrypt 2, entered your email and gotten a message that you already have an account, but don’t know the password, you need to issue a &lt;a href='https://account.axcrypt.net/en/Home/PasswordReset'&gt;password reset&lt;/a&gt;. Click on the link and follow the instructions. If you’re already using a strong password for your AxCrypt files, you should consider using that as your account password.</value>

  <data name="FaqStopFromSecuring" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>How can I stop anyone from securing my files?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqStopFromSecuringAnswer1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Short answer: You can’t. Follow-up question: Why would you want to?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqStopFromSecuringAnswer2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If you install AxCrypt, anyone with access to your computer can secure your files. This is sometimes seen as a risk with installing AxCrypt. However, this is not the case. The real risk is with ‘…anyone with access to your computer’. Anyone who can access your computer and run an installed copy of AxCrypt, can also install AxCrypt or any other security or deletion software. Anyone who can access your computer can delete your files, and probably format your hard disk. Anyone with physical access can also throw it out the window, steal it, use it for target practice with a shotgun or any other activity that may prove detrimental to the health of your files.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqStopFromSecuringAnswer3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The point is that it makes no sense to restrict access to AxCrypt – it’s the access to the computer that needs to be restricted! That’s why you should always use a password protected screen saver and always have a password on your account. Because then, if your files are secured with AxCrypt, your information will stay safe even in the face of loss or theft of your computer or media with the files on.</value>

  <data name="FaqWhatHappensExpire" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>What happens when my subscription expires?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqWhatHappensExpireAnswer1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If you stop subscribing to Premium or Business, you will fall back to the Viewer or Free plan after the end of your subscription period. You won’t have to worry about your files, because you’ll never get locked out of your data.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqWhatHappensExpireAnswer2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>With the Windows version, your files will be re-encrypted with 128-bit AES encryption, rather than the 256-bit AES algorithm that was used when you were on a subscription. If you are using AxCrypt on macOS, you will be unable to encrypt new files. You can still decrypt and view the encrypted files. The content of encrypted files can’t be updated. That means you have to either decrypt them, or get a paid subscription to keep using AxCrypt like before.</value>

  <data name="FaqWhatPlatforms" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>What platforms does AxCrypt run on?</value>

  <data name="FaqWhyPasswordSignIn" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Why does AxCrypt only ask for a password during sign-in? Isn’t that insecure?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqWhyPasswordSignInAnswer1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>While you are signed in to AxCrypt, offline or online, AxCrypt will not ask you again for the same password. This feature makes usage of AxCrypt much more convenient, and saves you from the trouble of re-entering the password every time.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqWhyPasswordSignInAnswer2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Security is a chain only as strong as its weakest link. In your local system, there are so many other ways to get at your data that to sacrifice the convenience of a password cache just to ‘feel’ safer, was not thought to be a good idea.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqWhyPasswordSignInAnswer3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>But what’s then the use of AxCrypt if anyone can walk up to my PC and just double-click?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqWhyPasswordSignInAnswer4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Under the heading Documentation &gt; Security &gt; Local PC Security you will find a discussion about what is needed to protect your PC locally, and why. The important thing for this discussion is: If anyone can walk up to your PC and it’s not protected by a password-protected screen-saver you have no protection anyway! All that is needed for a would-be attacker is access to a PC with for example a diskette or CD-drive, a USB-port or an Internet connection, and it’s a few seconds work to install a keylogger or a trojan. Do not trust a PC that has been left unattended and unprotected.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqWhyPasswordSignInAnswer5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The second reason for the password cache is that if you do not need to enter it every time, you may actually find it reasonable to use a longer and stronger password than otherwise, thus increasing security.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqWhyPasswordSignInAnswer6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If you are concerned about physical access to your own computer there are other measures you should take first. If you want to, you can always sign out from AxCrypt when leaving your computer.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqWhySecure" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Why secure files with strong encryption?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqWhySecureAnswer1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Why do you need encryption in order to secure your files? In two words: privacy and confidentiality.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqWhySecureAnswer2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>As private persons, we nowadays store lots of information on our computers that is not necessarily secret, but just simply private. Many of us also at times have the need to use employer-owned computers and servers, as well as public servers, to store such information. It might be copies of electronic invoices, private letters, your CV etc.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqWhySecureAnswer3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In all these situations you might feel a little more comfortable knowing that regardless of physical access to the files by network administrators, service personnel or even other family members in your home network, your private information is still kept private.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqWhySecureAnswer4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>As employees we frequently are responsible for information that is sensitive in various ways. It might be salaries if you’re a manager, or customer data if you’re in sales or support etc. This information is kept in confidence by you, and you have a responsibility to care for it as best you can.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqWhySecureAnswer5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In many cases it’s not really enough to just store it on the corporate network server and apply appropriate restrictive access permissions. The information and files are still always available to support staff, network administrators etc. Even if you trust your colleagues, as you should, mistakes do happen and sometimes it’s simply human to be curious. Anyone finding a file with his or her name on it will be sorely tempted to sneak a peek…</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqWhySecureAnswer6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Finally, there are an increasing number of cases where legislation and similar rules come into play such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, HIPAA, where encryption of confidential data is required under certain circumstances.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqWhySecureAnswer7" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In these and similar situations encryption programs such as AxCrypt provide a secure and convenient method to provide privacy and confidentiality as appropriate.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqWhyTimeStap" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Why is the file time-stamp set to the time of securing the file?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqWhyTimeStapAnswer1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The default operation of AxCrypt when securing a plain-text file, is to store the original files time-stamps inside the secured file and to set the time-stamps of the resulting secured file to the time when it was most recently secured. The rationale for this behavior is as follows:</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqWhyTimeStapAnswer2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Many backup and file-synchronization software programs depend on the modification time of files to determine if it has been modified since the last run. This test fails, if the secured file retains the original date of the plain-text file and at worst the file does not get copied/backed up etc.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqWhyTimeStapAnswer3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Good security software will ensure that securing the same file twice produces completely different secured files, to make it harder to determine if the file is the same as another file, or another earlier version of a file. If the time-stamp is retained, an attacker will get a high-precision time-stamp that more or less uniquely identifies each and every file thus leaking what might be important information about the file. (File size will remain the same, since the securing is deterministic, but this is a much weaker assertion).</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqWhyTimeStapAnswer4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Semantically, securing a file is a transformation of the file, and this should be reflected in the time-stamp. Note that the original plain-text time-stamps still will be restored if the security is removed from the file!</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqWhyTimeStapAnswer5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If AxCrypt ever should support multi-file archives, there’s no choice but to use the time of securing it, otherwise it’ll make it very inconsistent – which time-stamp should a multi-file AxCrypt archive which happens to contain exactly one file use (which by the way is the case today, the file format supports multiple files, but AxCrypt has not implemented this functionality yet).</value>

  <data name="GdprBlock1Heading" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>What is the GDPR?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="GdprBlock1Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a binding legislative act concerning the protection of personal data and individual rights. The GDPR replaces the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="GdprBlock1Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>It was designed to harmonize data privacy laws across Europe, to protect and empower all EU citizens data privacy and to reshape the way organizations approach data privacy. The GDPR requires companies to implement reasonable ways to protect their data, such as encryption, to protect it against data loss or exposure.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="GdprBlock1Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The enforcement date of the GDPR is 25 May 2018.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="GdprBlock2Heading" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Who is affected by it?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="GdprBlock2Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The GDPR applies to all organizations located within the EU, or outside of the EU, processing and holding the personal data of EU citizens, in order to: offer goods or services, or monitor their behaviour within the EU.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="GdprBlock3Heading" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>How can file encryption help towards compliance?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="GdprBlock3Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>As Recital 83 in the GDPR states:</value>
  </data>
  <data name="GdprBlock3Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>”In order to maintain security and to prevent processing in infringement of this Regulation, the controller or processor should evaluate the risks inherent in the processing and implement measures to mitigate those risks, such as encryption.”</value>
  </data>
  <data name="GdprBlock3Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Organizations have to make sure that their personal data is stored securely, whether on-premise or cloud-based, in order to prevent costly data breaches. Files that have been encrypted will be rendered useless when breached.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="GdprBlock4Heading" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>What are the penalties for non-compliance?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="GdprBlock4Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Organizations can be fined up to 4% of annual global turnover for breaching GDPR or €20 Million – whichever is greater. This is the maximum fine that can be imposed for the most serious infringements. It is important to note that these rules apply to both controllers and processors – meaning ‘clouds’ will not be exempt from GDPR enforcement.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="GdprBlock5Heading" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>How does the GDPR handle personal data breaches?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="GdprBlock5Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In the case of a personal data breach, the controller shall without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, notify the personal data breach to the supervisory authority.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="GdprBlock6Heading" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>What are my main responsibilities under the GDPR?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="GdprBlock6Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If your organization handles personal data, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) states that you are expected to put into place comprehensive but proportionate governance measures. These measures should minimize the risk of breaches and uphold the protection of personal data. The exact responsibilities that apply are different for every organization, depending on its size, industry and what kind of data is being stored.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="GdprBlock7Heading" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Is my website GDPR compliant?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="GdprBlock7Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>According to &lt;a href='https://www.vpnmentor.com/blog/report-only-34-percent-of-websites-in-the-eu-are-ready-for-gdpr/'&gt;vpnMentor&lt;/a&gt; as little as 34% of websites in the EU are currently GDPR compliant. “Most of the websites either have old privacy policies, and in some cases no privacy policy at all, and are in no way ready for the stricter privacy guidelines.”</value>
  </data>
  <data name="GdprBlock7Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In order to determine which websites collect data, and therefore need to update their privacy policy, vpnMentor based their research on sites that use MailChimp to collect user Email addresses. They have collected as many 100 websites per country, and looked at their privacy policy, if they had one, to determine if it was GDPR compliant.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="GdprBlock8Heading" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>How will Brexit impact the GDPR? Will it apply to businesses in the UK?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="GdprBlock8Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If your business is located in the UK, it will also have to comply with the EU regulation. The UK has stated that it will comply with the GDPR, and that its compliance will not be affected by Brexit.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="GdprBlock9Heading" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Where can I find more reliable information on the GDPR?</value>

    <value>What is &lt;span&gt;AxCrypt`s Group Feature&lt;/span&gt;?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="GroupGuidesHeading1Paragraph1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>AxCrypt's Group Feature is designed to enhance organizational efficiency by facilitating businesses to manage users via structured departmental groups hence streamlining file access restrictions, and implementing granular key management.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="GroupGuidesHeading2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Why use &lt;span&gt;AxCrypt`s Group Feature&lt;/span&gt;?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="GroupGuidesHeading2Paragraph1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Imagine a company with several departments like Finance, HR, and IT. AxCrypt's Group Feature allows you to create distinct groups for each department, ensuring that only the relevant team members have access to the necessary documents.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="GroupGuidesHeading2Paragraph2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>For example, Finance team members would access only financial documents, HR personnel would manage employee records, and IT staff would handle technical data. This structure maintains data confidentiality and significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="GroupGuidesHeading2Paragraph3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>AxCrypt’s Group Feature allows you to assign specific roles within each group, such as Admins or regular members, which helps in managing access and responsibilities effectively. For added security and convenience, the Group Masterkey feature enables Admins to recover encrypted files across all groups without needing individual passwords. This is particularly useful during team transitions, employee departures, or when dealing with password issues, as it simplifies access management without compromising security.</value>

    <value>The financial service industry today is more digital and data-intensive than ever before. People are increasingly using their phones and computers more than their wallets and books to pay, invest, and manage their finances. Internet banking has also replaced most of the operations that were traditionally performed physically in a bank. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This rapid surge in the volumes of finance data being generated by users everyday, also makes it highly vulnerable to cyber attacks and data breaches. Data breaches in the financial service industry are the &lt;b&gt;second most expensive&lt;/b&gt;, costing an average of $5.72 million. Small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) are the worst affected by data breaches, as they account for &lt;b&gt;42% of all data breaches,&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;60% of SMBs shut down&lt;/b&gt; within 6 months of a breach. Encryption is a proactive approach to securing your financial data that can shield it at all times.</value>

    <value>Instead of just locking a file, encryption transforms the contents of a file into an unreadable and undecipherable format. Using an encryption algorithm like AES, it rearranges, shifts, replaces, and mixes a file’s contents. The encryption keys used with the algorithm dictate the precise sequence of these transformations, allowing for the reversal of the encryption process (decryption) to restore the contents of a file to its original state. &lt;br/&gt;Unlike alternative security methods like password protection of files, file encryption with the AES-256 provides an unbreakable security measure. With a key length of 256, it becomes practically impossible to break an encrypted file, even with the most powerful supercomputers available today. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This complex process ensures that sensitive files are protected at all times, and only the authorized users with access to keys can decrypt the files.</value>

    <value>The healthcare sector is rapidly seeing an exponential increase in the volume of sensitive data being generated everyday. From patient’s details to Electronic Health Records (EHR), healthcare providers have a lot to protect for. Approximately &lt;b&gt;30% of the world's data&lt;/b&gt; volume is being generated by the healthcare industry, and this number is expected to grow tremendously in the near future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This exponential increase in the healthcare data also makes it highly vulnerable to devastating cyber attacks and data breaches. Healthcare has the &lt;b&gt;highest cost for a data breach&lt;/b&gt; out of all industries costing an average of $11 million, and it was the &lt;b&gt;third most attacked&lt;/b&gt; industry in 2022. With these alarming stats, it becomes critically important for healthcare service providers to prioritize their data security, especially with data at rest. Thankfully, there is a powerful and highly effective measure for sensitive healthcare data called encryption. File encryption protects a file by transforming its contents, making it unreadable and undecipherable to unauthorized users.</value>

From contracts and client information to intellectual property and litigation documents, legal professionals handle a constant stream of highly sensitive information that requires superior protection.  Even a minor security breach can have devastating consequences, leading to financial losses and reputational damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; AxCrypt understands the critical need for robust data security in the legal field. Our award-winning file encryption software empowers legal professionals to protect their confidential information at every stage, ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations and fostering a climate of trust with clients.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Whether you're collaborating on a complex litigation case, managing sensitive client contracts, or exchanging confidential documents, AxCrypt provides a simple yet powerful solution. Our on-the-go encryption capabilities ensure secure file sharing with colleagues and clients, while cloud storage integration allows for convenient access to encrypted data from any device. Additionally, AxCrypt's automatic encryption features streamline workflows, protecting sensitive documents the moment they are created or edited.</value>

    <value>Encryption as a process, transforms the contents of any legal file into an unreadable and undecipherable format using an encryption key. With an encryption algorithm like AES, it rearranges, shifts, replaces, and mixes a file’s contents. The encryption keys used with the algorithm dictate the precise sequence of these transformations, allowing for the reversal of the encryption process (decryption) to restore the contents of a file to its original state.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike alternative security methods like password protection, which simply locks the files, file encryption with the AES-256 provides an unbreakable security measure. With a key length of 256, it becomes practically impossible to break an encrypted file, even with the most powerful supercomputers available today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This complex process ensures that sensitive files such as contracts and client records etc., are protected at all times, and only the authorized users with access to keys can decrypt the files.</value>

    <value>The tech and IT sectors are some of the most targeted sectors today in terms of data breaches, ransomware attacks, and cyber threats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ransomware attacks in the IT sector have surged by &lt;b&gt;47% in 2023.&lt;/b&gt; Additionally, &lt;b&gt;43% of enterprises failed&lt;/b&gt; a compliance audit last year, making them 10x more vulnerable to data breaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These alarming trends underscore the significant importance of data encryption in the IT sector. Encryption for data at rest, acts as a protective shield for IT files, securing them all times from unauthorized access. It safeguards sensitive data, helps comply with regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, FIPs, etc., and gives organizations control over their data privacy and security measures.</value>

    <value>&lt;span&gt;AxCrypt&lt;/span&gt; Legacy Version</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Legacy-Version-Point1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>AxCrypt Legacy was designed to provide secure file encryption for users, offering reliable and effective protection through a simple passphrase system. It played a major role in making file encryption accessible to both personal and professional users, ensuring that only authorized individuals could access encrypted data. Its user-friendly interface allowed many to easily protect sensitive files, even if they were unfamiliar with encryption technologies.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Legacy-Version-Point2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The Legacy version introduced essential AES encryption capabilities that met the needs of its time, allowing users to perform multiple encryption operations efficiently. By setting the stage for future advancements, Axcrypt Legacy showcased our commitment to advanced encryption. Although AxCrypt Legacy is no longer actively supported, files encrypted with it remain secure and can still be decrypted using AxCrypt 2, ensuring continued access to important data. We appreciate the vital role AxCrypt Legacy played in our development and encourage users to transition to AxCrypt 2 to benefit from enhanced AES- 256 file encryption and other latest features.</value>

  <data name="LegacyFaq1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>What’s new in AxCrypt 2 compared to the legacy version?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="LegacyFaq1Ans" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>AxCrypt 2 introduces a modern interface, a unified password system, and enhanced encryption features. Unlike the legacy version, it includes a streamlined sign-in process and advanced functionalities for easier file management and sharing.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="LegacyFaq2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>How does AxCrypt 2 handle file decryption?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="LegacyFaq2Ans" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>With AxCrypt 2, you use a single password to decrypt all your files. This simplifies file management compared to the legacy version, where different passwords were needed for each file.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="LegacyFaq3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Can I still use the old AxCrypt 1.x?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="LegacyFaq3Ans" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>While AxCrypt Legacy is still available, we strongly recommend upgrading to AxCrypt 2 for enhanced security and user experience. The new version offers advanced AES- 256 encryption unlike the AES- 128 encryption that Axcrypt Legacy provides.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="LegacyFaq4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In which operating systems is AxCrypt 2 available?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="LegacyFaq4Ans" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>AxCrypt 2 is available on multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="LegacyFaq5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>How does AxCrypt 2 improve password management?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="LegacyFaq5Ans" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>AxCrypt 2 eliminates the need for multiple passwords by allowing you to use a single, strong password for all your encrypted files. This not only makes it easier to manage your files but also enhances overall security by reducing the risk of weak passwords.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="LegacyFaq6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Is self-decryption supported in AxCrypt 2?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="LegacyFaq6Ans" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>No, AxCrypt 2 does not support self-decryption of files. This feature was removed due to significant security risks, such as the potential for self-decrypting files to contain strongly encrypted information, including malicious software, which is impossible for antivirus programs to screen.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="LegacyFaq7" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>How does AxCrypt 2 enhance security over AxCrypt 1.x?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="LegacyFaq7Ans" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>AxCrypt 2 offers several security enhancements, including stronger AES- 256 encryption algorithms, a unified password system, and improved file sharing features. Additionally, the new version provides better protection against common security risks through its streamlined sign-in process and the latest interface.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="LegacyFaq8" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Will upgrading to AxCrypt 2 affect my existing encrypted files?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="LegacyFaq8Ans" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Upgrading to AxCrypt 2 will not affect your existing encrypted files. The new version is fully compatible with files encrypted using AxCrypt 1.x, and it also offers an auto-conversion feature to quickly adapt your files to the new system.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="LegacyFaq9" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>How do I upgrade from AxCrypt Legacy to AxCrypt 2?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="LegacyFaq9Ans" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>To upgrade from AxCrypt Legacy to AxCrypt 2, simply install AxCrypt 2 over your existing AxCrypt 1 installation. No need to uninstall first. No harm done either.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="LegacyOpenMessage" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>AxCrypt 2 uses a new file format.

You can open legacy AxCrypt 1.x files but unless they are converted you have to provide the original password even when signed in.

Enable automatic conversion of AxCrypt 1.x files (recommended)?</value>

  <data name="MasterKeyBlock1Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Imagine an important financial document being encrypted after creating the yearly revenue report.

  </data>
  <data name="MasterKeyBlock1Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Enter Master key! With Master key enabled, the administrators of the business can always recover any file encrypted by the business members. In the above case the new financial team just has to ask their administrator and the financial document can easily be recovered, even if the original user left the company.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="MasterKeyBlock1Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>As long as the business has one or a couple administrators who make sure to keep track of their credentials, no files will ever be lost due to employees leaving or forgetting their passwords.</value>

    <value>Master key and security</value>
  </data>
  <data name="MasterKeyBlock2Text1" xml:space="preserve">

    <value>In terms of security, you can view Master key as an automatic sharing of files with the administrators of the business. Administrators will automatically be able to recover files which has their Master key applied. This is no less secure than simply using AxCrypt's tried and tested Key Sharing feature.</value>

    <value>What is AxCrypt’s Partner Program?</value>
  </data>

  </data>
  <data name="PartnerFaq3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Is there any cost of joining the program?</value>

    <value>AxCrypt has a sophisticated password strength evaluator based on measuring the actual strength of the password. It must also be at least 8 effective characters long.

We evaluate the password by estimating the strength, which is based on how long and complex the password is.

The evaluation entirely disregards parts of the password that is recognized as being among the 1,000 most common passwords, as well as white space. For example the password 'secretX password Y 123456' is evaluated as just 'XY', since spaces, 'secret', 'password' and '123456' are ignored!

We classify the password in 4 categories of increasing strength, were we do not accept any password in the lowest category. The above example is not accepted for that reason.</value>

    <value>As an important part of the work of creating a user-friendly website, we look at the user pattern of those who visit the site. We analyze user behaviour to make the user experience better. The purpose of using cookies is therefore to improve the customer experience. To analyze the information, we use the analysis tool Google Analytics. Google Analytics uses cookies/cookies (small text files that the site stores on the user's computer), which records the user's IP address, and provides information about each user's online movement. Examples of what the statistics give us answers to are; how many people visit different pages, how long the visit lasts, which sites the users come from and which browsers are used. None of the cookies allows us to associate information about your use of the site with you as an individual. Cookie data is automatically deleted 14 months after registration. You can do it yourself and manage the use of cookies by adjusting settings on your browser. The information collected by Google Analytics is stored on Google's servers in the United States. Information received is subject to Google guidelines for Privacy. An IP address is defined as personal information because it can be traced back to a particular hardware and thus to an individual. We anonymize the user's IP address before the information is stored and processed by Google. Thus, the anonymized IP address cannot be used to identify the individual user. Your IP address is also logged for a short period by our web servers. The user's IP-address, time of day, website address, HTTP status, number of bytes sent, HTTP referrer and HTTP user agent is logged for 15 days. Beyond this point, the data is deleted.</value>

    <value>How can AxCrypt help with the GDPR?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="RegulatoryComplianceBlock1Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a binding legislative act concerning the protection of personal data and individual rights. It was designed to harmonize data privacy laws across Europe, to protect and empower all EU citizens data privacy, and to reshape the way organizations approach data privacy.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="RegulatoryComplianceBlock1Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The GDPR requires companies and organizations to implement reasonable ways to protect their data, such as encryption, to protect it against data loss or exposure. This is where AxCrypt can help.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="RegulatoryComplianceBlock1Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>As Recital 83 in the GDPR states: ”In order to maintain security and to prevent processing in infringement of this Regulation, the controller or processor should evaluate the risks inherent in the processing and implement measures to mitigate those risks, such as encryption.”</value>
  </data>
  <data name="RegulatoryComplianceBlock1Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>You have to make sure that personal data is stored securely, whether on-premise or cloud-based, in order to prevent costly data breaches. Files that have been encrypted will be rendered useless when breached.</value>

    <value>Is AxCrypt HIPAA compliant?</value>

  </data>
  <data name="RegulatoryComplianceBlock2Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act protects the privacy and security of health information. Compliance of HIPAA only applies to organizations and processes. It does not apply to software, meaning that an encryption solution such as AxCrypt can’t be HIPAA compliant. Although, AxCrypt may suffice as (part of) a Technical Safeguard.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="RegulatoryComplianceBlock2Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The appropriate use of encryption and other Technical Safeguards is governed by the HIPAA Security Standards, 45 CFR 160, 162 and 164. The relevant section is 164.312 Technical Safeguards. No recommendations or requirements concerning specific encryption technologies are made there either, it’s specifically pointed out that the regulation is technology-neutral. It’s up to each and every organization to evaluate its position and risks, and then implement required or addressable specifications.</value>

  </data>
  <data name="RegulatoryComplianceBlock2Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Although the standard in no way refers to it except in comments, the CMS Internet Security Policy, which is the current view of Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services for their own use, does specify some minimal technology levels for certain cases. AxCrypt meets these requirements for transmission over the Internet – but your organization must independently evaluate if is sufficient to use the same level as the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services.</value>

    <value>The HIPAA Security Standard does allow the use of encryption as the basis for Access Control, that is to say to protect the privacy of data at rest (stored on a hard disk as opposed to traversing the Internet for example).

    <value>Why is AxCrypt secure?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="SecurityBlock1Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>AxCrypt is secure because it endeavors to only use accepted practices and algorithms and does not attempt to invent any new encryption algorithms or methods.  It’s also open source; Anyone may inspect the source code, check it for errors, omissions or back doors. It has been used and inspected for vulnerabilities for over 15 years and tried by more than 30 million users, without any known weaknesses.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="SecurityBlock2Heading" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>How secure is AxCrypt?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="SecurityBlock2Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>This question breaks down to effective encryption key lengths. The key length used is 128 or 256 bits – exhaustive search is not currently believed to be an option in either case and it is computationally infeasible in cryptographic terms. The problem lies with the passwords used – this is the weak point. You can read more about what to consider when choosing a password below.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="SecurityBlock3Heading" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Password considerations</value>
  </data>
  <data name="SecurityBlock3ListItem1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The name of the file, as well as the size, may be recovered.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="SecurityBlock3ListItem2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If the file has been viewed or edited with an application that creates temporary copies of the content (such as Microsoft Office), those temporary copies may still be available for undeletion on your hard disk.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="SecurityBlock3Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>AxCrypt uses AES-128 or AES-256 in the Premium version – but if you want to achieve that level of security you must give it 128 or 256 bits of truly ‘random’ data. This is very hard to do, but the easiest way to even approach this is to use the password generator included in Premium.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="SecurityBlock3Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>To actually get 128 or 256 bits, you’ll in practice have to save this password in a text file, and then keep that text file very secret.Using typical English language in a password, 128 bits is approximately equivalent to 10 ‘random’ words, and 256 bits thus twice this. Do not use meaningful sentences and absolutely not famous or even obscure quotations!By introducing variations on the case, as well as non-alphabetic characters you can reduce the number of words necessary. It’s not recommended to use less than 5 words. If you use a completely random selection of upper and lower-case letters and digits, you need 22 characters to achieve 128 bits security, and thus 44 characters for 256 bits. (The above is a slight simplification of the issue, but it should serve.)The shredding, or wiping, feature of AxCrypt allows you to erase files in a way that makes it impossible to recover the contents with undeletion software. However, there are some caveats:</value>

  <data name="SecurityBlock5Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>An account key is what enables the implementation of various new rich features, such as allowing other team members to open secured files with their own passwords. In technical terms, an AxCrypt Account key consists of a public key pair composed of a public (non-secret) and a private (secret) part and some other meta data.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="SecurityBlock5Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The account key is always kept secured with your password as well, although one part of it is not secret and is used when securing files for you and your team. For you, the benefit is that you can change the password for all files in one single operation. For your team members, the benefit is that you and your team can allow each other to open secured files without sharing passwords by just specifying the email address of the other member.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="SecurityBlock5Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Anyone can use your email address to allow you to open a secured file with your own passphrase, and you can allow anyone with an email address to open a file secured by you. All this is enabled by the public part of the account key being available on our server.</value>

    <value>Algorithms</value>
  </data>
  <data name="SecurityBlock6Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The cryptological primitives are AES-128 or AES-256 for bulk encryption, PBKDF2 with HMAC-512 for key deriviation, 4096-bit RSA for the account key, and HMAC-512 for integrity checking.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="SecurityBlock6Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The algorithms used are deemed secure as such, to the best of our knowledge, by the US Government and the Internet community. Please see the documents package and the source code for details.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="SecurityBlock6Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Key wrapping of the password is done using the NIST specification for AES Key Wrap. The key derived from the password with PBKDF2-SHA512 is only used as a key encrypting key.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="SecurityBlock6Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>As a brute force counter measure, key wrapping is done with at least 5 000 iterations, increasing the work effort with approximately 12 bits. The actual iteration count is determined dynamically, a typical value is 25 000 to 100 000, adding 14-17 bits of effective key-length. The faster machine you install AxCrypt on – the better the security!</value>
  </data>
  <data name="SecurityBlock6Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>AxCrypt uses the Advanced Encryption Standard with 128-bit or 256-bit keys in Counter mode with a ‘random’ IV for the data encryption.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="SecurityBlock6Text6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>For integrity verification AxCrypt uses HMAC-SHA512, i.e. Hash Message Authentication Code using SHA-512 with 512-bit output.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="SecurityBlock6Text7" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The pseudo random number generator (PRNG) used is primarily the operating system provided one, in some cases with added entropy added.</value>

  <data name="SecurityBlock6Text8" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>There may well be bugs in our implementation though – that is why it’s open source, so you and our peers may review it and keep it safe.

  <data name="SecurityBlock7Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The appropriate use of encryption and other Technical Safeguards is governed by the HIPAA Security Standards, 45 CFR 160, 162 and 164. The relevant section is 164.312 Technical Safeguards. No recommendations or requirements concerning specific encryption technologies are made there either, it’s specifically pointed out that the regulation is technology-neutral. It’s up to each and every organization to evaluate its position and risks, and then implement required or addressable specifications.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="SecurityBlock7Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Although the standard in no way refers to it except in comments, the CMS Internet Security Policy, which is the current view of Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services for their own use, does specify some minimal technology levels for certain cases. AxCrypt meets these requirements for transmission over the Internet – but your organization must independently evaluate if is sufficient to use the same level as the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services.</value>

    <value>We were looking for a way to store backups of sensitive financial data with one of our cloud providers and not risk exposure to their employees or outside forces. We decided that encrypting the backups before moving them to the cloud platform would solve that problem. However, the encryption process needed to be simple and easy to do or it would not be done. Furthermore, we wanted a safety net in case that person left the company and left us with encrypted files. AxCrypt provided an encryption solution that is super easy to use, and with the company account, we can implement a master key which will allow IT to decrypt any files in case of problems arising from users leaving encrypted files or forgetting passwords. Our financial person now happily goes about her job without having to wrestle with an onerous encryption process to provide the needed security. !</value>

    <value>Do you do your backups to CD’s or DVD’s, the cloud, or just to files on another hard-disk using backup programs or perhaps WinZip? If you secure the backup-archive with AxCrypt, you can then store the backup or file in any place, without fear of your privacy being violated should it get lost.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="UsageTipsBackupsText2" xml:space="preserve">

  <data name="UsageTipsConfidentialDataText2" xml:space="preserve">

    <value>Confidential email</value>
  </data>
  <data name="UsageTipsConfidentialEmailText1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>A quick and easy method to communicate between two parties. Use AxCrypt to send private email messages.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="UsageTipsConfidentialEmailText2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Write the initial message using Notepad, WordPad or Microsoft Word. Secure the result, add the recipient to the team member list and send it to the other party.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="UsageTipsConfidentialEmailText3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The other party will now be able to open and edit the message directly, respond etc, and then reply and attach the automatically updated secure file in a quick and convenient manner.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="UsageTipsConfidentialEmailText4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>This is not quite as easy as regular mail – but not far from it – and most approaches instead require encrypting and decrypting using the clipboard with cut and paste.</value>

    <value>Here you can learn what AxCrypt is made for and also find different situations where other users like you have found AxCrypt useful.</value>

  <data name="UsageTipsHideShowHeading" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Hide/show the .axx extension</value>
  </data>
  <data name="UsageTipsHideShowText1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Normally, AxCrypt files will display the .axx extension or not, depending on your global Windows settings. This behavior may be changed by modifying the Windows registry.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="UsageTipsHideShowText2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>AxCrypt does not implement any configuration settings to keep things simple, but if you really want this, you can modify the registry manually. If you do not know how to do this, you should probably refrain as the full implications may not be clear then.</value>

    <value>Making archives of secured files</value>
  </data>
  <data name="UsageTipsMakingArchivesText1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>AxCrypt does not support storing many files in an archiver, like WinZip. This is for a reason – because WinZip (and Windows XP or later Compressed Folders) already does it so well!</value>
  </data>
  <data name="UsageTipsMakingArchivesText2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>So, simply create your .zip-file, secure whatever you want to be there in it with AxCrypt, and then move it to the .zip-file. The archive can now be opened in WinZip or in a Compressed Folder view, and you can work with the archive as usual, including opening, editing, adding and deleting individual files.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="UsageTipsNetworksHeading" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Networks</value>
  </data>
  <data name="UsageTipsNetworksText1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>When you secure your data with AxCrypt, it’s never seen on the network, the server or backups in the clear.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="UsageTipsNetworksText2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>When you store a document on a Local Area Network-server, the data is usually stored in clear-text there, even when access controls are in place, accessible to all system-administrators as well as others who by chance or mistake happen to get read-access.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="UsageTipsNetworksText3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The data also travels the network in the clear, easily sniffable by anyone on the same network segment. Backups are also seldom secured, so anyone gaining access to a backup-tape has potential access, regardless of the access controls enforced on the server.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="UsageTipsNetworksText4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>All of these cases are handled when the data is secured with AxCrypt.</value>

    <value>Pre-distribution</value>
  </data>
  <data name="UsageTipsPreDistributionText1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Some information should be confidential up to a certain time, and then it’s not. It might be a movie trailer, a quarterly financial report or something similar. Secure your file – document, movie trailer or report, distribute it by any means and be assured that it’s unreadable until  a time when you choose to release the information.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="UsageTipsPreDistributionText2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Information that must be prepared ahead of time, and is beneficial to have the distribution done beforehand – even though it must not be disclosed until a certain time. Use AxCrypt to secure the document, for example the PDF of the financial report. You can then distribute it by any means, hours and days ahead of time, the information is out there but unreadable. When it’s time to disclose, simply publish the password used. This reduces peak server loads and eases distribution.</value>

  </data>
  <data name="UsageTipsSecuringFoldersText1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>AxCrypt secures files, individually. However, you can designate folders as ‘secured’. The folders will be monitored for new files, and AxCrypt will secure all new files with a single click, or when you sign out.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="UsageTipsSecuringFoldersText2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>You can also select multiple files, including all files in a folder, to be secured in a single operation. They still remain individual files, and the folder itself is not secured, just the files in it.</value>

  </data>
  <data name="UsageTipsTargetUseListItem3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Send secured files via email as regular attachments. To send secure email, add the recipient as allowed to open the file and, then send your secured files as regular attachments.
